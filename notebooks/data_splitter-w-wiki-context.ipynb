       "'What was the reason for Mohammed Ali Beshr\\'s resignation from office in 2013?\\nContext from page 0: \\nSolar power in France including overseas territories reached an installed capacity figure of 11.2 GW by the end of 2020.\\n\\nThe solar power capacity is set to continue expanding with a target of around 18–20 GW installed by 2023.  However, wavering political support for new installations slowed PV deployment since the record year of 2011, when 1,700 MW had been installed. However, the sector appears to have recovered its previous pace, with nearly 1,400 MW coming on line in the first half of 2021.\\n\\nIn January 2016, the  President of France, François Hollande, and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in Gwalpahari, Gurgaon, India. The ISA will focus on promoting and developing solar energy and solar products for countries lying wholly or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The alliance of over 120 countries was announced at the Paris COP21 climate summit. One of the hopes of the ISA is that wider deployment will reduce production and development costs, and thus facilitate increased deployment of solar technologies, including in poor and remote regions.\\n\\nHistory \\nSolar PV installations in France started being substantial only from around 2008. Between 2009 and 2011 PV capacity grew almost tenfold, from a relatively low level. \\n\\nIn its 2014 report \"Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics\", the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) not only blames the French government for a lack of support, but also criticizes it for having \"hastily freeze or reduce support mechanisms\" for further photovoltaic deployment. \\nThe EPIA also asserts that opposition from the conventional energy sector led to a negative image of PV technology in the public opinion. \\nThe French solar association SOLER urged the French government for more support and submitted a five-point plan in Spring 2014.\\n\\nSolar power in France continued growing steadily and reached a cu\\nContext from page 1: \\n\\n\\nIntroduction \\n\\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE PAPER\\n\\nLawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa\\'ida or An Associated Force\\n\\nThis white paper sets forth a legal framework for considering the circumstances in which the U.S. government could use lethal force in a foreign country outside the area of active hostilities against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al-Qa\\'ida or an associated force of al-Qa\\'ida—that is, an al-Qa\\'ida leader actively engaged in planning operations to kill Americans. The paper does not attempt to determine the minimum requirements necessary to render such an operation lawful; nor does it assess what might be required to render a lethal operation against a U.S. citizen lawful in other circumstances, including an operation against enemy forces on a traditional battlefield or an operation against a U.S. citizen who is not a senior operational leader of such forces. Here the Department of Justice concludes only that where the following three conditions are met, a U.S. operation using lethal force in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al-Qa\\'ida or an associated force would be lawful: (1) an informed; high-level official of the U.S. government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States; (2) capture is infeasible, and the United States continues to monitor whether capture becomes feasible; and (3) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles. This conclusion is reached with recognition of the extraordinary seriousness of a lethal operation by the United States against a U.S. citizen, and also of the extraordinary seriousness of the threat posed by senior operational al-Qa\\'ida members and the loss of life that would result were their operations successful.\\n\\nThe President has authority to respond to the imminent \\nContext from page 2: \\n\\n\\n2017 \\nDespite the promises of lower output from other countries, no evidence of changes was seen. U.S. output was higher. Also, China\\'s economic problems caused concern. Brent fell 3% in the second week of the year to $55.45. WTI fell to $52.37 for a nearly 3% loss. On January 18, with a strong dollar and expectations of higher U.S. production, Brent fell to $53.92 and WTI to $51.08. With U.S. production and inventories up, even a lower dollar and decreased production by OPEC nations did not cause oil prices to rise as much as they could have. WTI reached $53.07 and Brent $55.44 on January 26.\\n\\nOn February 8, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported the second-largest increase in oil supplies, the day after WTI reached $52.17 and Brent reached $55.05, the lowest in three weeks for both, thanks to a strong dollar. Still, prices moved higher on February 8. With the increase in U.S. supplies and OPEC\\'s plan to keep cutting production, oil ended the next week down, with WTI at $53.40 and Brent crude at $55.81.\\n\\nOn February 22, Qatar oil minister Mohammed Saleh Al Sada said countries not in OPEC were not cutting production as much as expected, and oil fell as a result. Continued increases in U.S. crude inventories also contributed to a decline, with WTI at $53.59 and Brent at $55.76.\\n\\nAfter U.S. inventories reached a record at the end of February, oil fell for three straight days and closed at its lowest level in nearly a month, with WTI at $52.61 and Brent at $55.08. Oil continued to fall, with Brent crude reaching $51.50, the lowest since November 30, on March 9, a day after a 5% drop, the most it had moved in a day all year. WTI fell more than 5% March 8 and closed at $49.28 the next day, the lowest since November. WTI fell to $47.36 on March 14, while Brent crude reached $50.25, before lower inventories resulted in higher prices.\\n Crude inventories set a record but gasoline inventories went down more than expected and summer gasoline demand was expected \\nContext from page 3: \\nFood riots may occur when there is a shortage and/or unequal distribution of food. Causes can be food price rises, harvest failures, incompetent food storage, transport problems, food speculation, hoarding, poisoning of food, or attacks by pests. Hence, the pathway between food related issues such as crop failure, price hike or volatility and an actual “riot” is often complex.\\n\\nSome argue that volatile and high food price are just part of a “perfect storm” combining with climate change, population growth, resource scarcity, and urbanization leading to social unrest. When the public becomes too desperate in such conditions, they may attack shops, farms, homes, or government buildings to attain bread or other staple foods such as grain or salt, as in the 1977 Egyptian bread riots. Often, it is more than an issue of hunger and the need to obtain bread for immediate caloric satisfaction; food riots are part of a larger social movement, such as the Russian revolution or the French revolution. Thus in places with low political freedom there is an increased likelihood for social unrest when food prices are volatile or suddenly rise. Historically, women have been heavily involved in leading food riots; food riots have thus served as a form of female political action even in societies without women\\'s suffrage or other guaranteed political rights.\\n\\nTwenty-first century\\nDuring 2007–2008, a rise in global food prices led to riots in various countries. A similar crisis recurred in 2010–2011.\\n\\nDue to a wheat crop failure in the mid-western United States because of drought in 2012, as well as simultaneous dryness during the start of the Russia\\'s wheat season, a deficient monsoon rainfall in India and a drought in Africa\\'s Sahel region, predictions were made for a possible outbreak of protests and riots akin to previous years. Yaneer Bar-Yam, the president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, said that computer modelling suggested an outbreak of instability, while he also \\nContext from page 4: \\nEnergy in Syria is mostly oil and gas. Some energy infrastructure was damaged by the Syrian civil war.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nElectricity\\n\\nPre-2011 \\nIn the 2000s, Syria\\'s electric power system struggled to meet the growing demands presented by an increasingly energy-hungry society. Demand grew by roughly 7.5% per year during this decade, fueled by the expansion of Syria\\'s industrial and service sectors, the spread of energy-intensive home appliances, and state policies (i.e. high subsidies and low tariffs) that encouraged wasteful energy practices. Syria\\'s inefficient transmission infrastructure compounded these problems: In 2002, Electricity Minister Munib Saem al-Daher stated that 26% of the country\\'s total electricity production was wasted in transmission, amounting to USD 57.7 billion in losses. These factors together resulted in increasingly frequent power cuts, which in turn fueled public frustration.\\n\\nThroughout this period, the Syrian government sought to close the supply gap by investing in new electricity generation infrastructure. Investments moved away from oil-powered infrastructure and toward gas-fueled power plants, reflecting Syria\\'s declining domestic oil production, improved access to natural gas, and the superior efficiency of gas-fed combined cycle power plants. New investments relied significantly on international technical expertise to execute projects, notably by the German firm Siemens, but also by firms hailing from Iran, India, and elsewhere. They also relied on international financing, including from the European Investment Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development.\\n\\nWartime disruption \\nSyria\\'s conflict wrought havoc on the country\\'s electricity system, leading to increasingly frequent blackouts across the country, disruptions to all forms of economic activity, and reports that electrical fires increased due to problems with the electrical grid.\\n\\nInfrastructural damage \\nSwathes of Syria\\'s generation and transmission infrastructure wer'"
