       "'What is the role of sodium triethylborohydride?\\nContext from page 0: \\nLithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a borohydride and known in organic synthesis as a reducing agent for esters.  Although less common than the related sodium borohydride, the lithium salt offers some advantages, being a stronger reducing agent and highly soluble in ethers, whilst remaining safer to handle than lithium aluminium hydride.\\n\\nPreparation\\nLithium borohydride may be prepared by the metathesis reaction, which occurs upon ball-milling the more commonly available sodium borohydride and lithium bromide:\\n NaBH4 + LiBr → NaBr + LiBH4\\n\\nAlternatively, it may be synthesized by treating boron trifluoride with lithium hydride in diethyl ether:\\n BF3 + 4 LiH → LiBH4 + 3 LiF\\n\\nReactions\\nLithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than sodium borohydride. In mixtures of methanol and diethyl ether, lithium borohydride is able to reduce esters to alcohols and primary amides to amines. In contrast, these substrates are unaffected by sodium borohydride. The enhanced reactivity is attributed to the polarization of the carbonyl substrate by complexation to the lithium cation.\\n\\nChemoselectivity\\nThe use of lithium borohydride is particularly advantageous in some preparations due to its higher chemoselectivity relative to other popular reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride. For instance, unlike lithium aluminium hydride, lithium borohydride reduces esters, nitriles, lactones, primary amides, and epoxides, while sparing nitro groups, carbamic acids, alkyl halides, and secondary/tertiary amides.\\n\\nHydrogen generation\\nLithium borohydride reacts with water to produce hydrogen. This reaction can be used for hydrogen generation.\\n\\nEnergy storage\\n\\nLithium borohydride is renowned as one of the highest-energy-density chemical energy carriers. Although presently of no practical importance, the solid liberates 65\\xa0MJ/kg heat upon treatment with atmospheric oxygen. Since it has a density of 0.67\\xa0g/cm3, oxidation of liquid lithium borohydride gives 43\\xa0MJ/L. In comparison, gasoline gi\\nContext from page 1: \\nReductions with metal alkoxyaluminium hydrides are chemical reactions that involve either the net hydrogenation of an unsaturated compound or the replacement of a reducible functional group with hydrogen by metal alkoxyaluminium hydride reagents.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nSodium borohydride and lithium aluminium hydride are commonly used for the reduction of organic compounds. These two reagents are on the extremes of reactivity—whereas lithium aluminium hydride reacts with nearly all reducible functional groups, sodium borohydride reacts with a much more limited range of functional groups. Diminished or enhanced reactivity may be realized by the replacement of one or more of the hydrogens in these reagents with alkoxy groups.\\n\\nAdditionally, substitution of hydrogen for chiral alkoxy groups in these reagents enables asymmetric reductions. Although methods involving stoichiometric amounts of chiral metal hydrides have been supplanted in modern times by enantioselective catalytic reductions, they are of historical interest as early examples of stereoselective reactions.\\n\\nThe table below summarizes the reductions that may be carried out with a variety of metal aluminium hydrides and borohydrides. The symbol \"+\" indicates that reduction does occur, \"-\" indicates that reduction does not occur, \"±\" indicates that reduction depends on the structure of the substrate, and \"0\" indicates a lack of literature information.\\n\\nMechanism and Stereochemistry\\n\\nPrevailing Mechanism\\nReduction by alkoxyaluminium hydrides is thought in most cases to proceed by a polar mechanism. Hydride transfer to the organic substrate generates an organic anion, which is neutralized either by protic solvent or upon acidic workup.\\n\\nReductions of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds may occur in a 1,2 sense (direct addition) or a 1,4 sense (conjugate addition). The tendency to add in a 1,4 sense is correlated with the softness of the hydride reagent according to Pearson\\'s hard-soft acid-base theory. Experimental result\\nContext from page 2: \\nOctahydrotriborate is the boron hydride B3H8−.  It forms a variety of salts that are colorless and air-stable.  The  tetrabutylammonium salt is soluble in organic solvents such as acetonitrile and methylene chloride.  The anion is an intermediate is the synthesis of various higher boron hydrides, such as pentaborane(9).  B3H8− can be viewed as the conjugate base of triborane B3H9.\\n\\nPreparation\\nOctahydrotriborate is prepared by partial oxidation of borohydride with iodine or boron trifluoride:\\n3BH4−  +  I2  →  B3H8−  +  2H2  +  2I−\\n5BH4−  +  4BF3O(C2H5)2  →  2B3H8−  +  2H2  +  4O(C2H5)2  + 3BF4−\\n\\nStructure and reactions\\nAs shown by X-ray crystallography of various salts, B3H8− consists of an distorted triangle of three BH2 vertices. Two edges of the triangle are occupied by bridging hydrides. \\n\\nIt is converted to the bromide B3H7Br− using HBr (illustrating its hydridic character):\\nB3H8−  + HBr  →   B3H7Br−  + H2\\nPyrolysis of this bromide gives pentaborane(9). \\n5 B3H7Br−   →   3 B5H9  +  5 Br−  +  4 H2\\n\\nAlso consistent with its basicity, B3H8_ functions as a bidentate ligand in a variety of coordination complexes, e.g. Cr(B3H8)2.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBorohydrides\\nContext from page 3: \\nBorohydride refers to the anion  and its salts.  Borohydride is also the term used for compounds containing , for example cyanoborohydride () and triethylborohydride (B(C2H5)3H−). Borohydrides find wide use as reducing agents in organic synthesis. The most important borohydrides are lithium borohydride and sodium borohydride, but other salts are well known (see Table). Tetrahydroborates are also of academic and industrial interest in inorganic chemistry.\\n\\nHistory\\nAlkali metal borohydrides were first described in 1940 by Hermann Irving Schlesinger and Herbert C. Brown. They synthesized lithium borohydride (LiBH4) from diborane (B2H6):\\n\\n2 MH  +  B2H6   →   2 M[BH4]  (M = Li, Na, K, etc.)\\nCurrent methods involve reduction of trimethyl borate with sodium hydride.\\n\\nStructure\\nIn the borohydride anion and most of its modifications, boron has a tetrahedral structure.  The reactivity of the B−H bonds depends on the other ligands.  Electron-releasing ethyl groups as in triethylborohydride render the B−H center highly nucleophilic.  In contrast, cyanoborohydride is a weaker reductant owing to the electron-withdrawing cyano substituent.  The countercation also influences the reducing power of the reagent.\\n\\nUses\\nSodium borohydride is the borohydride that is produced on the largest scale industrially, estimated at 5000 tons/y in 2002. The main use is for the reduction of sulfur dioxide to give sodium dithionite:\\nNaBH4  +  8\\xa0NaOH  +  8\\xa0SO2   →   4\\xa0Na2S2O4  +  NaBO2  +  6\\xa0H2O\\nDithionite is used to bleach wood pulp. Sodium borohydride is also used to reduce aldehydes and ketones in the production of pharmaceuticals including chloramphenicol, thiophenicol, vitamin A, atropine, and scopolamine, as well as many flavorings and aromas.\\n\\nPotential applications\\nBecause of their high hydrogen content, borohydride complexes and salts have been of interest in the context of hydrogen storage. Reminiscent of related work on ammonia borane, challenges are associated with slow kinetics and low yi\\nContext from page 4: \\nSodium triethylborohydride is an organoboron compound with the formula NaBH(C2H5)3.  It is a colorless, pyrophoric solid that is commercially available in toluene solution, unlike the related LiBH(C2H5)3 which is typically sold as a THF solution. It is commonly used for the reductive activation of homogeneous catalysts, converting metal halides to hydrides.  Sodium triethylborohydride has been prepared by treating a hot toluene slurry of sodium hydride with triethylborane. The trimethylborohydride analogue, which is assumed to be structurally similar to the triethylborohydride, adopts a tetrameric structure in toluene solution.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSodium compounds\\nBorohydrides\\nOrganoboranes\\nReducing agents'"
