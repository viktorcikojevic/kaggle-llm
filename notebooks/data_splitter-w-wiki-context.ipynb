       "'What is the second law of thermodynamics?\\nContext from page 0: \\nIn classical thermodynamics, entropy is a property of a thermodynamic system that expresses the direction or outcome of spontaneous changes in the system. The term was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth century from the Greek word τρoπή (transformation) to explain the relationship of the internal energy that is available or unavailable for transformations in form of heat and work. Entropy predicts that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, despite not violating the conservation of energy. The definition of entropy is central to the establishment of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems cannot decrease with time, as they always tend to arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. Entropy is therefore also considered to be a measure of disorder in the system.\\n\\nLudwig Boltzmann explained the entropy as a measure of the number of possible microscopic configurations  of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which correspond to the macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. He showed that the thermodynamic entropy is , where the factor k has since been known as the Boltzmann\\'s constant.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nDifferences in pressure, density, and temperature of a thermodynamic system tend to equalize over time. For example, in a room containing a glass of melting ice, the difference in temperature between the warm room and the cold glass of ice and water is equalized by energy flowing as heat from the room to the cooler ice and water mixture. Over time, the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room achieve a balance. The entropy of the room has decreased. However, the entropy of the glass of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the room has decreased. In an isolated system, such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler regions always results in a net increas\\nContext from page 1: \\nThe Clausius theorem (1855) states that for a thermodynamic system (e.g. heat engine or heat pump) exchanging heat with external reservoirs and undergoing a thermodynamic cycle,\\n\\nwhere  is the infinitesimal amount of heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir and  is the temperature of the external reservoir (surroundings) at a particular instant in time. The closed integral is carried out along a thermodynamic process path from the initial/final state to the same initial/final state. In principle, the closed integral can start and end at an arbitrary point along the path.\\n\\nIf there are multiple reservoirs with different temperatures , then Clausius inequality reads:\\n\\nIn the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds. The reversible case is used to introduce the state function known as entropy. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In other words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir. Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around.\\n\\nThe generalized \"inequality of Clausius\"\\n\\nfor an infinitesimal change in entropy S applies not only to cyclic processes, but to any process that occurs in a closed system.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe Clausius theorem is a mathematical explanation of the second law of thermodynamics. It was developed by Rudolf Clausius who intended to explain the relationship between the heat flow in a system and the entropy of the system and its surroundings. Clausius developed this in his efforts to explain entropy and define it quantitatively. In more direct terms, the theorem gives us a way to determine if a cyclical process is reversible or irreversible. The Clausius theorem provides a quantitative formula for understanding the second law.\\n\\nClausius was one of the first to work on the idea of entropy and is even responsible for giving it t\\nContext from page 2: \\nThe first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes, distinguishing three kinds of transfer of energy, as heat, as thermodynamic work, and as energy associated with matter transfer, and relating them to a function of a body\\'s state, called internal energy.\\n\\nThe law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of any isolated system (for which energy and matter transfer through the system boundary are not possible) is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\\n\\nThe first law for a thermodynamic process without transfer of matter is often formulated as\\n\\n,\\n\\nwhere  denotes the change in the internal energy of a closed system (for which heat or work through the system boundary are possible, but matter transfer is not possible),  denotes the quantity of energy supplied to the system as heat, and  denotes the amount of thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible; work  done by a system on its surrounding requires that the system\\'s internal energy  decrease or be consumed, so that the amount of internal energy lost by that work must be resupplied as heat  by an external energy source or as work by an external machine acting on the system (so that  is recovered) to make the system work continuously.\\n\\nThe first law for a thermodynamic process with transfer of matter requires a further statement: \\'With due account of the respective reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then\\n\\n,\\n\\nwhere  denotes the internal energy of the combined system, and  and  denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems.\\'\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nContext from page 3: \\nIn thermodynamics, entropy is a numerical quantity that shows that many physical processes can go in only one direction in time. For example, you can pour cream into coffee and mix it, but you cannot \"unmix\" it; you can burn a piece of wood, but you can\\'t \"unburn\" it. The word \\'entropy\\' has entered popular usage to refer a lack of order or predictability, or of a gradual decline into disorder. A more physical interpretation of thermodynamic entropy refers to spread of energy or matter, or to extent and diversity of microscopic motion.\\n\\nIf you reversed a movie of coffee being mixed or wood being burned, you would see things that are impossible in the real world. Another way of saying that those reverse processes are impossible is to say that mixing coffee and burning wood are \"irreversible\". Irreversibility is described by an important law of nature known as the second law of thermodynamics, which says that in an isolated system (a system not connected to any other system) which is undergoing change, entropy increases over time.\\n\\nEntropy does not increase indefinitely. A body of matter and radiation eventually will reach an unchanging state, with no detectable flows, and is then said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic entropy has a definite value for such a body and is at its maximum value. When bodies of matter or radiation, initially in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, are brought together so as to intimately interact and reach a new joint equilibrium, then their total entropy increases. For example, a glass of warm water with an ice cube in it will have a lower entropy than that same system some time later when the ice has melted leaving a glass of cool water. Such processes are irreversible: An ice cube in a glass of warm water will not spontaneously form from a glass of cool water. Some processes in nature are almost reversible. For example, the orbiting of the planets around the sun may be thought of as practical\\nContext from page 4: \\nThe laws of thermodynamics define a group of physical quantities, such as temperature, energy, and entropy, that characterize thermodynamic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. The laws also use various parameters for thermodynamic processes, such as thermodynamic work and heat, and establish relationships between them. They state empirical facts that form a basis of precluding the possibility of certain phenomena, such as perpetual motion. In addition to their use in thermodynamics, they are important fundamental laws of physics in general, and are applicable in other natural sciences.\\n\\nTraditionally, thermodynamics has recognized three fundamental laws, simply named by an ordinal identification, the first law, the second law, and the third law. A more fundamental statement was later labelled as the zeroth law, after the first three laws had been established. \\n\\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics defines thermal equilibrium and forms a basis for the definition of temperature: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.\\n\\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that, when energy passes into or out of a system (as work, heat, or matter), the system\\'s internal energy changes in accord with the law of conservation of energy.\\n\\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems never decreases. Another form of the statement is that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body.\\n\\nThe third law of thermodynamics states that a system\\'s entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.\\n\\nThe first and second laws prohibit two kinds of perpetual motion machines, respectively: the perpetual motion machine of the first kind which produce'"
