       "'prompt:  What is the main advantage of having larger and thicker buttocks in humans?\\n ### context: Context: In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher subcutaneous fat and proportionally wider hips The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.\\n\\nSexual selection\\n\\nMarkus J \\n\\nIn many cultures, the buttocks play a role in sexual attraction Augmentation with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess adipose fat in the lower portion of the trunk, the buttocks and thighs, the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body fat It is one of the major defining features of the buttocks This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion.\\n\\nKnee\\n\\nHuman knee joints are enlarged for the same reason as the hip – to better support an increased amount of body weight With sexual selection, an unattractive individual is more likely to have access only to an inferior mate who is likely to pass on many deleterious mutations to their joint offspring, who are then less likely to survive.\\n\\nSexual selection is often thought to be a likely explanation for other female-specific human traits, for example breasts and buttocks far larger in proportion to total body size than those found in related species of ape Upon losing a pedipalp males experience a significant decrease in body weight that provides them with enhanced locomotor abilities and endurance, enabling them to better search for a mate and mate-guard after mating The gluteus muscle helps to prevent the upper trunk of the body from \"pitching forward\" or falling over.\\n\\nHip and pelvis\\n\\nModern human hip joints are larger than in quadrupedal ancestral species to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them Physiologically, the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting.\\n\\nC\\nCalcium – Calcium ions (Ca2+) contribute to the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell Another explanation is that a main function of the penis is to impregnate, while female genitals may alter shape upon interaction with male organs, especially as to benefit or hinder reproductive success.\\n\\nNon-human primates are optimal models for human biomedical research because humans and non-human primates share physiological characteristics as a result of evolution Considering the additional benefit of the weight advantage e.g With more bones and joints in the foot, the leg is both shorter and heavier at the far end, which makes it difficult to move rapidly.\\n\\nIn humans and other great apes, another possible advantage of a plantigrade foot is that it may enhance fighting performance by providing a more powerful stance for striking and grappling.\\n\\nPlantigrade foot occurs normally in humans in static postures of standing and sitting Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\\n\\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally Women have a greater thickness of this pubic disc which allows more mobility of the pelvic bones, hence providing a greater diameter of pelvic cavity during childbirth.\\n\\nFunction\\nAnalysis of the pelvis shows the skinny regions function as arches, transferring the weight of the upright trunk from the sacrum to the hips It is a remnant of baculum evolved likely due to change in mating practice.\\n\\nThe human penis cannot be withdrawn into the groin, and it is larger than average in the animal kingdom in proportion to body mass Decreased stiffness of tendons gives women much lower predisposition to muscle strains but soft ligaments are much more prone to injuries (ACL tears are 2-8x more common among women than men).\\n Anti-inflammatory properties \\n Mediate formation of female secondary sex characteristics\\n Accelerate metabolism\\n Increased fat storage in some body parts such as breasts, buttocks, and legs but decreased abdominal and visceral fat (androgenic obesity).Estradiol also regulates energy expenditure, body weight homeostasis, and seems to have much stronger anti-obesity effects than testosterone in general  This fat accumulation is accompanied by a loss of subcutaneous fat in the face, arms, legs, and buttocks.\\n\\nAdverse effects\\nCosmetic concerns may cause patients to refuse or stop treatment Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.\\n\\nMicroorganisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis colonize the skin surface Women have wider hips, and thus a greater subpubic angle, in order to allow for child birth.\\n\\nIntrapubic angle\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBones of the pelvis increased size of body structures Redundant buttock-fat and buttock-skin.\\n\\nContraindications\\nInsufficient buttock tissue This allows for a much greater range of motion.\\n\\nSee also\\nLegs\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n \\nSkeletal system Having a healthy mate improves the chances of producing offspring with inherited genetic protection from various diseases and a healthy mate is more likely to be a good parent (Hamilton & Zuk, 1982; Thornhill, 1993).\\n\\nOther studies discovered WHR as a signal of attractiveness as well, beyond just examining body fat and fertility The belief is that the advantages of larger size in competition, will give the larger males an opportunity to increase their paternal success by allowing them to be more selective of females.\\n\\nSometimes males choose females who are large and better conditioned to avoid being eaten The ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\\n\\n3) Protection from abdominal cavity pressure changes It is always safest if a graspable part of the object remains outside the body.\\n\\nHygiene\\nThe biological function of the anus is to expel intestinal gas and feces from the body; therefore, when engaging in anal masturbation, hygiene is important Richard Dawkins has stated that it is possible to interpret all the differences between the sexes as stemming from this.\\n\\nSex differences in humans include a generally larger size and more body hair in men, while women have larger breasts, wider hips, and a higher body fat percentage  Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength.\\n\\nOther donor sites for autologous breast reconstruction include the buttocks, which provides tissue for the SGAP and IGAP (superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator, respectively) flaps Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.\\n\\nCross-section\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nSkin colour\\n\\nHuman skin shows high skin colour variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues Humans may also lose their hair as a result of hormonal imbalance due to drugs or pregnancy.\\n\\nIn order to comprehend why humans have significantly less body hair than other primates, one must understand that mammalian body hair is not merely an aesthetic characteristic; it protects the skin from wounds, bites, heat, cold, and UV radiation Adipose tissue gives \"mechanical cushioning\" to the body, among other functions Older men show android fat distributions more often than younger men  which may be due to lifestyle changes, or hormonal changes related to age.\\nOlder adults have a greater waist-to-hip ratio than young adults which indicates high levels of android fat in older adults Increased muscular strength increases stability of joints such as the elbow.\\n Like other sports, use to equipment appropriate to one\\'s ability, body size, and muscular strength.\\n Avoiding any repetitive lifting or pulling of heavy objects (especially over one\\'s head)\\n\\nVibration dampers (otherwise known as \"gummies\") are not believed to be a reliable preventative measure Few studies have shown long term benefits of surgical intervention.\\n\\nAdditional images\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n  - \"Superficial Anatomy of the Lower Extremity: Cutaneous Nerves of the Posterior Aspect of the Lower Extremity\"\\n\\nSpinal nerves\\nButtocks In terms of sexual attractiveness, the glute specialist Bret Contreras considers in physio-anthropological terms that this is based upon a sub-conscious assessment of the relationship between a physical capability to survive and prosper, and the ability to raise a family.\\n\\n\\'It stands to reason that both males and females were attracted to nice glutes, instinctively making the connection to big, strong glutes and survival, reproduction, hunting and protection.\\'\\n\\nProminent gluteal muscles are often used in art in order to imply an ability to move in a powerful, dynamic fashion; virility and fertility; and to meet aesthetic considerations in these regards.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Gluteal crease\\n\\nAdditional images\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n McMinn, RMH (Ed) (1994) Last\\'s Anatomy: Regional and applied (9th Ed) Other primates have straighter and wider pelvises compared to humans Benefits of this method include less stress on the back, hips, knees and ankles.\\n\\nBenefits\\nMost land-based aerobic exercisers do not incorporate strength training into their schedules and therefore adding aquatic exercise can greatly improve their health In some nonhuman mammals, mating signals via release of an odor enhanced by increased apocrine secretion may be a factor in sexual selection.\\n\\nPhysical human traits that are controlled by a single gene are uncommon The additional strain that highly developed abdominal muscles place on the pubic bone explains the higher prevalence of osteitis pubis in young players  Again, the idea of a man\\'s investment being vital to the child\\'s survival is a central fixture of a hypothesis regarding concealed ovulation, even as the evolutionary benefits accrue to the child, the woman, and her clandestine partner, and not to her regular sexual partner.\\n\\nAs a side effect of bipedalism\\nPawlowski presents the importance of bipedalism to the mechanics and necessity of ovulation signaling Monotremes and marsupials also possess a fourth pair of bones, the prepubes or \"marsupial bones\", which extend forward from the pubes, and help to support the abdominal muscles and, in marsupials, the pouch Immune privilege is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to protect the most vital sensory organs and reproductive structures that would be otherwise severely impaired during an inflammatory response As a result, humans evolved the ability to sweat: a process which was facilitated by the loss of body hair.\\n\\nAnother factor in human evolution that also occurred in the prehistoric past was a preferential selection for neoteny, particularly in females It has been suggested that there is an evolutionary advantage due to the tendency of primates, non-primates and humans to have oral sex The term is from the Greek  (), meaning \"tallow\",  and  (), meaning \"rump\".\\n\\nSteatopygia, a genetic characteristic leading to increased accumulation of adipose tissue in the buttock region, is most notably (but not solely) found among the Khoisan of Southern Africa However, there is an increased incidence of prostate hyperplasia with age.\\n Body weight and fat distribution appear to be normal.\\n There is a lack of grossly apparent behavioral phenotypes, including in regards to sexual behavior For example, there are hockey pants that provide extra cushion that protect the thigh, coccyx, and buttocks The production of the female sex hormone estradiol (an estrogen) at puberty, causes the perineal skin to thicken by keratinising, and this reduces the risk of infection A few species are known to allopreen other areas, including the rump, tail, belly and underwing.\\n\\nSeveral hypotheses have been advanced to explain the behaviour: that it assists in effective grooming, that it assists in recognition of individuals (mates or potential sexual partners), and that it assists in social communication, reducing or redirecting potential aggressive tendencies Because of their elastic properties, these soft tissues can spread ground contact reaction forces over a longer time period, and thus reduce the risk of musculoskeletal wear or damage, and they can also store the energy of these forces, returning it at the next step and thus reducing the cost of walking and, particularly, running, where vertical forces are higher.\\n\\nClinical significance\\n\\nThe anatomy and shape of a person’s longitudinal and transverse arch can dictate the types of injuries to which that person is susceptible The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.\\n\\nEven if physical activity is increased, patients may still harbor long term psychological effects due to excess skin and fat Modern HDE for prostate cancer has a variety of advantages and benefits over conventional androgen deprivation therapy with castration, including fewer side effects like osteoporosis, hot flashes, and impairment in cognitive, emotional, and sexual domains, potentially superior quality of life, and considerable cost savings  \\nCopulation times:  A longer copulation time generally means increased mating success for a male  Humans have a remnant tail, the coccyx, and the human equivalent of docking is coccygectomy.\\n\\nUsage\\nUsage varies from animal to animal In a review investigating primates that exhibit extended female sexuality, it was noted that females engaging in extended sexuality benefited from increased offspring protection and paternal care from males.\\n\\nEnhanced reproductive success\\nSecondly, in order to outweigh the aforementioned costs, mating during infertile phases should increase females\\' reproductive success by increasing the number of offspring produced Lordosis in particular increases the likelihood of a successful copulation, and therefore overall reproductive success The resemblance to females benefit these young males when trying to occupy a territory with many males already present because the young males can gain information and access to a territory that would not be accessible to them otherwise.\\n\\nThere is a big cost to not looking like a male when it comes to defending a territory or attracting a mate   The vestibular end organs have a smaller surface area and are thicker.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading Because dental treatment is complex, a multi-disciplinary approach is best.\\n\\nOther features \\nPeople with ED often have certain cranial-facial features which can be distinctive: frontal bossing is common, longer or more pronounced chins are frequent, broader noses are also very common Conditions such as hip dysplasia and arthritis can often be treated with appropriate medications that help the body handle pain, inflammation, or joint wear and tear.\\n\\nAnimals which are prospective candidates for hip replacement should have no other spinal, neural, or rear leg abnormalities, in order to be significantly helped by a hip joint procedure.\\n\\nSince the reduced joint mobility seen in conditions such as dysplasia may result in loss of muscle mass and quality as a dog ages, there is often an advantage in having hip replacement whilst the dog is at an early age, while muscle is more likely to re-develop, rather than in old age when convalescence is longer and more difficult\\n ### A: Enhanced physical performance\\n ### B: Greater protection against injury\\n ### C: Higher aesthetic appeal\\n ### D: Improved balance and stability\\n ### E: Increased pleasure during sexual intercourse'"
