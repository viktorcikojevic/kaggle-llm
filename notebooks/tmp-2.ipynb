      "Context: The Penrose process (also called Penrose mechanism) is theorised by Roger Penrose as a means whereby energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole. Penrose mechanism exploits that by diving into the ergosphere, dumping an object that was given negative energy, and returning back with more energy than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way, rotational energy is extracted from the black hole, resulting in the black hole being spun down to a lower rotational speed. An object can gain energy by entering the black hole's rotation and then escaping from it, thus taking some of the black hole's energy with it (making the maneuver similar to the exploitation of the Oberth effect around \"normal\" space objects).\n",
      "\n",
      "This process of removing energy from a rotating black hole was proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1969 and is called the Penrose process. Results from computer models show that the Penrose process is capable of producing the high-energy particles that are observed being emitted from quasars and other active galactic nuclei.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ergosphere size\n",
      "The size of the ergosphere, the distance between the ergosurface and the event horizon, is not necessarily proportional to the radius of the event horizon, but rather to the black hole's gravity and its angular momentum. However, this is not a reverse of the Penrose process, as both increase the entropy of the black hole by throwing material into it.\n",

      "History\n",
      "The idea that angular momentum and energy may be transferred from a rotating black hole to a particle being scattered by it was proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971. As the ergosphere causes the magnetosphere inside it to rotate, the outgoing flux of angular momentum results in extraction of energy from the black hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blandford–Znajek process requires an accretion disc with a strong poloidal magnetic field around a spinning black hole. Roger Penrose had proposed a mechanism that relies on frame-dragging-related effects for extracting energy and momentum from rotating black holes. This implies that the Kerr black hole has the form of gravitational soliton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mass of rotational energy\n",
      "If the complete rotational energy  of a black hole is extracted, for example with the Penrose process, the remaining mass cannot shrink below the irreducible mass. In the Penrose diagram, an object traveling faster than light will cross the black hole and will emerge from another end into a different space, time or universe. Near an active galactic nucleus, one of these particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes, as described by the Penrose process. As the mass of the black hole or its rotation speed increases, the size of the ergosphere increases as well.\n",
