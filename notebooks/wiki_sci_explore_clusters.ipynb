Iota Horologii b has a minimum mass 1.94 times that of Jupiter; however, preliminary astrometric measurements suggest that the object may be around 24 Jupiter masses and would therefore be a brown dwarf.\\n\\nDetection and discovery\\nThe discovery of Iota Horologii b was the result of a long-term survey of forty Solar analog stars that was begun in November 1992. The planet represents the first discovery of an extrasolar planet with a European Southern Observatory instrument, with the data found at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.\\n\\nThe Keplerian signal found the planet to have an orbital period of 320.1 days, indicative of an orbiting planet with minimum mass of 2.26 Jupiter masses. Iota Horologii b was announced in the summer of 1999 as the first planet found by a team of planet hunters led by Martin Kürster.\\n\\nThe measurements of Iota Horologii show that the planet orbits the star approximately every 320 days. From this period, the known mass of the central star (1.25 solar masses) and the amplitude of the velocity changes, a mass of at least 2.26 times that of planet Jupiter is deduced for the planet.\\n\\nIt revolves around the host star in a somewhat elongated orbit. If it were located in the Solar System, this orbit would stretch from just outside the orbit of Venus (at 117 million km or 0.78 astronomical units [AU] from the Sun) to just outside the orbit of the Earth (at 162 million km or 1.08 AU). Because the planet is at least 720 times more massive than the Earth, it is predicted that Iota Horologii b is more similar to planet Jupiter.\\n\\nIn recent astrometric analysis of Iota Horologii b suggests that planet b may have as much as 24 times the mass of Jupiter with an inclination of 5.5 degrees from Earth's line of sight. With this calculations, Iota Horologii b may actually be an extremely dim brown dwarf and a substellar companion of Iota Horologii.

Paul Butler, 70 Virginis was one of the first stars confirmed to have planets orbiting it.  When first announced, 70 Virginis b was considered to be within its star\\'s habitable zone (preferably in the \"Goldilocks zone\"), but it was later confirmed that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\n\\n70 Virginis b is a gas giant extrasolar planet that is 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter and is in an eccentric 116-day orbit about its host. Its surface gravity is expected to be about six to eight times that of Jupiter\\'s.  At the time of discovery in January 1996, it was believed that the star was only 29 ly away resulting in the star being less luminous based on its apparent magnitude.  As a result, the planet\\'s orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was nicknamed Goldilocks (not too cold or too hot).\\n\\nThe Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was more distant from Earth and therefore brighter resulting in the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone.\\n\\nA significant update to the 70 Virginis system revised the orbit of the planet and used interferometry to show that, although the host star is similar in mass and temperature to the Sun, it is almost twice the radius of the Sun. The accuracy of these stellar parameters allowed the Habitable Zone to be calculated much more precisely, and orbital dynamics simulations show that a terrestrial planet can retain a stable orbit in the Habitable Zone despite the presence of the nearby eccentric giant planet.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n51 Pegasi b\\nTau Boötis b\\n55 Cancri b\\n47 Ursae Majoris b\\nUpsilon Andromedae b\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n SolStation: 70 Virginis\\n\\nExoplanets\\nVirgo (constellation)\\nGiant planets\\nExoplanets discovered in 1996\\nExoplanets detected by radial velocity',\n",

       "       'Agostic interaction is a term in organometallic chemistry for the interaction of a coordinatively-unsaturated transition metal with a C−H bond, when the two electrons involved in the C−H bond enter the empty d-orbital of a transition metal, resulting in a  three-center two-electron bond. Many catalytic transformations, e.g. oxidative addition and reductive elimination, are proposed to proceed via intermediates featuring agostic interactions. Agostic interactions are observed throughout organometallic chemistry in alkyl, alkylidene, and polyenyl ligands.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe term agostic, derived from the Ancient Greek word for \"to hold close to oneself\", was coined by Maurice Brookhart and Malcolm Green, on the suggestion of the classicist Jasper Griffin,  to describe this and many other interactions between a transition metal and a C−H bond. Often such agostic interactions involve alkyl or aryl groups that are held close to the metal center through an additional σ-bond.\\n\\nShort interactions between hydrocarbon substituents and coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes have been noted since the 1960s. For example, in tris(triphenylphosphine) ruthenium dichloride, a short interaction is observed between the ruthenium(II) center and a hydrogen atom on the ortho position of one of the nine phenyl rings.  Complexes of borohydride are described as using the three-center two-electron bonding model.  \\n\\nThe nature of the interaction was foreshadowed in main group chemistry in the structural chemistry of trimethylaluminium.\\n\\nCharacteristics of agostic bonds\\nAgostic interactions are best demonstrated by crystallography. Neutron diffraction data have shown that C−H and M┄H bond distances are 5-20% longer than expected for isolated metal hydride and hydrocarbons. The distance between the metal and the hydrogen is typically 1.8–2.3\\xa0Å, and the M┄H−C angle is in the range of 90°–140°. The presence of a 1H NMR signal that is shifted upfield from that of a normal aryl or alkane, often to the region normally assigned to hydride ligands. The coupling constant 1JCH is typically lowered to 70–100\\xa0Hz versus the 125\\xa0Hz expected for a normal sp3 carbon–hydrogen bond.\\n\\nStrength of bond\\nOn the basis of experimental and computational studies, the stabilization arising from an agostic interaction is estimated to be 10–15\\xa0kcal/mol. Recent calculations using compliance constants point to a weaker stabilisation (<10\\xa0kcal/mol). Thus, agostic interactions are stronger than most hydrogen bonds. Agostic bonds sometimes play a role in catalysis by increasing \\'rigidity\\' in transition states.  For instance, in Ziegler–Natta catalysis the highly electrophilic metal center has agostic interactions with the growing polymer chain.  This increased rigidity influences the stereoselectivity of the polymerization process.\\n\\nRelated bonding interactions\\nThe term agostic is reserved to describe two-electron, three-center bonding interactions between carbon, hydrogen, and a metal. Two-electron three-center bonding is clearly implicated in the complexation of H2, e.g., in W(CO)3(PCy3)2H2, which is closely related to the agostic complex shown in the figure. Silane binds to metal centers often via agostic-like, three-centered Si┄H−M interactions.  Because these interactions do not include carbon, however, they are not classified as agostic.\\n\\nAnagostic bonds\\nCertain M┄H−C interactions are not classified as agostic but are described by the term anagostic.  Anagostic interactions are more electrostatic in character. In terms of structures of anagostic interactions, the M┄H distances and M┄H−C angles fall into the ranges 2.3–2.9\\xa0Å and 110°–170°, respectively.\\n\\nFunction\\nAgostic interactions serve a key function in alkene polymerization and stereochemistry, as well as migratory insertion.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nAgostic interactions\\n\\nOrganometallic chemistry\\nChemical bonding',\n",

One example of a hexadentate ligand that can form complexes with soft metal ions is TPEN.  A commercially important hexadentate ligand is EDTA.\\n\\nThe denticity of hexadentate ligands is often denoted with the prefix κ6.\\n\\nTopology\\nThe way the donor atoms are joined together in the molecule is its topology. Some topologies are simple, such as the linear or ring shapes. The molecule can also be branched, either at a donor atom, or at a non-donor atom.

       "       'Salen refers to a tetradentate C2-symmetric ligand synthesized from salicylaldehyde (sal) and ethylenediamine (en). It may also refer to a class of compounds, which are structurally related to the classical salen ligand, primarily bis-Schiff bases. Salen ligands are notable for coordinating a wide range of different metals, which they can often stabilise in various oxidation states. For this reason salen-type compounds are used as metal deactivators. Metal salen complexes also find use as catalysts.\\n\\nSynthesis and properties\\nH2salen may be synthesized by the condensation of ethylenediamine and salicylaldehyde.\\n\\nComplexes of salen with metal cations may be made without isolating it from the reaction mixture. This is possible because the stability constant for the formation of the metal complexes are very high, due to the chelate effect.\\n\\nH2L + Mn+ → ML(n−2)+ + 2\\xa0H+\\n\\nwhere L stands for the ligand. The pyridine adduct of the cobalt(II) complex Co(salen)(py) (salcomine) has a square-pyramidal structure; it can act as a dioxygen carrier by forming a labile, octahedral O2 complex.\\n\\nThe name “salen ligands” is used for tetradentate ligands which have similar structures. For example, in salpn there is a methyl substituent on the bridge. It is used as a metal deactivation additive in fuels. The presence of bulky groups near the coordination site may enhance the catalytic activity of a metal complex and prevent its dimerization. Salen ligands derived from 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde fulfill these roles, and also increase the solubility of the complexes in non-polar solvents like pentane. Chiral “salen” ligands may be created by proper substitution of the diamine backbone, the phenyl ring, or both. An example is the ligand obtained by condensation of the C2-symmetric trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane with 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde. Chiral ligands may be used in asymmetric synthesis reactions, such as the Jacobsen epoxidation:\\n\\nRelated ligands\\n\\nA class of tetradentate ligands with the generic name acacen are obtained by the condensation of derivatives of acetylacetone and ethylenediamine. Cobalt complexes [Co(acacen)L2]+, selectively inhibit the activities of histidine-containing proteins through exchange of the axial ligands. These compounds show promise for the inhibition of oncogenesis.\\n\\nThe salan and salalen ligands are similar in structure to salen ligands, but have one or two saturated nitrogen-aryl bonds (amines rather than imines). They tend to be less rigid and more electron rich at the metal center than the corresponding salen complexes. Salans can be synthesized by the alkylation of an appropriate amine with a phenolic alkyl halide. The “half-salen” ligands have only one salicylimine group. They are prepared from a salicylaldehyde and a monoamine.\\n\\nThe name “salen” or “salen-type” may be used for other ligands that have similar environment around the chelating site, namely two acidic hydroxyls and two Schiff base (aryl-imine) groups. These include the ligands abbreviated as salph, from the condensation of 1,2-phenylenediamine and salicylaldehyde, and salqu, from the condensation of salicylaldehyde and 2-quinoxalinol.\\n\\nSee also\\nMetal salen complexes\\nBisthiosemicarbazones, a structurally related class of C2-symmetric imine based ligands\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOrganometallic chemistry\\nSchiff bases\\nTetradentate ligands',\n",

       "       '{{DISPLAYTITLE:C2-Symmetric ligands}}\\nIn homogeneous catalysis, C2-symmetric ligands refer to ligands that lack mirror symmetry but have C2 symmetry (two-fold rotational symmetry). Such ligands are usually bidentate and are valuable in catalysis. The C2 symmetry of ligands limits the number of possible reaction pathways and thereby increases enantioselectivity, relative to asymmetrical analogues. C2-symmetric ligands are a subset of chiral ligands. Chiral ligands, including C2-symmetric ligands, combine with metals or other groups to form chiral catalysts. These catalysts engage in enantioselective chemical synthesis, in which chirality in the catalyst yields chirality in the reaction product.\\n\\nExamples\\nAn early C2-symmetric ligand, diphosphine catalytic ligand DIPAMP, was developed in 1968 by William S. Knowles and coworkers of Monsanto Company, who shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This ligand was used in the industrial production of -DOPA.\\n\\nSome classes of C2-symmetric ligands are called privileged ligands, which are ligands that are broadly applicable to multiple catalytic processes, not only a single reaction type.\\n\\nMechanistic concepts\\nWhile the presence of any symmetry element within a ligand intended for asymmetric induction might appear counterintuitive, asymmetric induction only requires that the ligand be chiral (i.e. have no improper rotation axis). Asymmetry (i.e. absence of any symmetry elements) is not required. C2 symmetry improves the enantioselectivity of the complex by reducing the number of unique geometries in the transition states. Steric and kinetic factors then usually favor the formation of a single product.\\n\\nChiral fence\\n\\nChiral ligands work by asymmetric induction somewhere along the reaction coordinate. The image to the right illustrates how a chiral ligand may induce an enantioselective reaction. The ligand (in green) has C2 symmetry with its nitrogen, oxygen or phosphorus atoms hugging a central metal atom (in red). In this particular ligand the right side is sticking out and its left side points away. The substrate in this reduction is acetophenone and the reagent (in blue) a hydride ion. In absence of the metal and the ligand the Re face approach of the hydride ion gives the (S)-enantiomer and the Si face approach the (R)-enantiomer in equal amounts (a racemic mixture like expected). The ligand and metal presence changes all that. The carbonyl group will coordinate with the metal and due to the steric bulk of the phenyl group it will only be able to do so with its Si face exposed to the hydride ion with in the ideal situation exclusive formation of the (R) enantiomer. The re face will simply hit the chiral fence. Note that when the ligand is replaced by its mirror image the other enantiomer will form and that a racemic mixture of ligand will once again yield a racemic product. Also note that if the steric bulk of both carbonyl substituents is very similar the strategy will fail.\\n\\nOther C2-symmetric complexes\\nMany C2-symmetric complexes are known.  Some arise not from C2-symmetric ligands, but from the orientation or disposition of high symmetry ligands within the coordination sphere of the metal.  Notably, EDTA and triethylenetetraamine form complexes that are C2-symmetric by virtue of the way the ligands wrap around the metal centers.  Two isomers are possible for (indenyl)2MX2, Cs- and C2-symmetric.  The C2-symmetric complexes are optically stable.\\n\\nAsymmetric ligands\\nLigands containing atomic chirality centers such asymmetric carbon, which usually do not have C2-symmetry, remain important in catalysis.  Examples include cinchona alkaloids and certain phosphoramidites. P-chiral monophosphines have also been investigated.\\n\\nSee also\\n Chiral anion catalysis\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCoordination chemistry\\nStereochemistry\\nOrganometallic chemistry\\nLigands',\n",

       "       'Hauser bases, also called magnesium amide bases, are magnesium compounds used in organic chemistry as bases for metalation reactions. These compounds were first described by Charles R. Hauser in 1947.  Compared with organolithium reagents, the magnesium compounds have more covalent, and therefore less reactive, metal-ligand bonds. Consequently, they display a higher degree of functional group tolerance and a much greater chemoselectivity. Generally, Hauser bases are used at room temperature while reactions with organolithium reagents are performed at low temperatures, commonly at −78\\xa0°C.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nSolid state structure \\n\\nLike all Grignard dimers, Hauser bases derived from 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP) and HMDS are bridged by halides in the solid state. In contrast to Grignard reagents, dimeric amido bridged Hauser bases exist, too. All have one in common: they are bridged by less bulky amido ligands such as Et2N−, Ph3P=N− and iPr2N−. The displacement to halide bridges may be a result of the bulky groups on the amide ligand.\\n\\nSolution structure  \\nAlthough there is a great deal of information on the utility of these reagents, very little is known regarding the nature of Hauser bases in solution. One reason for that lack of information is that Hauser bases show a complex behaviour in solution. It was proposed that it could be similar to the Schlenk equilibrium of Grignard reagents in ether solution, where more than one magnesium containing species exists. In 2016, Neufeld et al. showed by diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY)  that the solution structure of iPr2NMgCl is best represented by the common Schlenk equilibrium:\\n\\niPr2NMgCl (A)  (iPr2N)2Mg (B) + MgCl2\\n\\nThis equilibrium is highly temperature dependent with heteroleptic (A) to be the main species at high temperatures and homoleptic (B) at low temperatures. \\nDimeric species with bridging chlorides and amides are also present in the THF solution, although alkyl magnesium chlorides do not dimerize in THF. At low temperatures, where an excess of MgCl2 is available MgCl2 co-coordinated species are present in solution, too.\\n\\nPreparation \\nThe Hauser bases are prepared by mixing an amine and a Grignard reagent.\\n\\nR2NH + R′MgX → R2NMgX + R′H X = Cl, Br, I\\n\\nUses \\nHauser bases are generally used as metalation reagents, like organolithiums or metal amides.\\nThe breakthrough in synthetic protocols of Hauser bases culminates in the 1980s and 1990s. Eaton and coworkers showed that iPr2NMgBr selectively magnesiate carboxamides in ortho position.\\nLater, Kondo, Sakamo and co-workers reported the utility of iPr2NMgX (X = Cl, Br) as selective deprotonation reagents (exclusively at the 2-position) for heterocyclic thiophene   and phenylsulphonyl-substituted indoles.\\n\\nA huge disadvantage of Hauser bases is their poor solubility in THF. In consequence, the metalation rates are slow and a huge excess of base is required (mostly 10 equiv.). This circumstance complicates the functionalization of the metaled intermediate with an electrophile.\\nA better solubility and reactivity was achieved by adding to the Hauser base stoichiometric amounts of LiCl.

       "       'In chemistry, an atom cluster (or simply cluster) is an ensemble of bound atoms or molecules that is intermediate in size between a simple molecule and a nanoparticle; that is, up to a few nanometers (nm) in diameter.  The term microcluster may be used for ensembles with up to couple dozen atoms.\\n\\nClusters with a definite number and type of atoms in a specific arrangement are often considered a specific chemical compound and are studied as such.  For example, fullerene is a cluster of 60 carbon atoms arranged as the vertices of a truncated icosahedron, and decaborane is a cluster of 10 boron atoms forming an incomplete icosahedron, surrounded by 14 hydrogen atoms.\\n\\nThe term is most commonly used for ensembles consisting of several atoms of the same element, or of a few different elements, bonded in a three-dimensional arrangement.  Transition metals and main group elements form especially robust clusters. Indeed, in some contexts, the term may refer specifically to a metal cluster, whose core atoms are metals and contains at least one metallic bond.  In this case, the qualifier poly specifies a cluster with more than one metal atom, and heteronuclear specifies a cluster with at least two different metal elements. Naked metal clusters have only metal atoms, as opposed to clusters with outer shell of other elements.  The latter may be functional groups such as cyanide or methyl, covalently bonded to the core atoms; or many be ligands attached by coordination bonds, such as carbon monoxide, halides, isocyanides, alkenes, and hydrides. \\n\\nHowever, the terms is also used for ensembles that contain no metals (such as the boranes and carboranes) and whose core atoms are held together by covalent or ionic bonds.  It is also used for ensembles of atoms or molecules held together by Van der Waals or hydrogen bonds, as in water clusters.\\n\\nClusters may play an important role in phase transitions such as precipitation from solutions, condensation and evaporation of liquids and solids, freezing and melting, and adsorbtion to other materials.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nAtom cluster compounds, including metal clusters, have been unwittingly used by humans since antiquity. The oldest artificially produced metal cluster may be calomel , which was known in India already in the 12th century.\\n\\nThe elucidation of the structure of cluster compounds only became possible in the 20th century. For instance, the existence of a mercury to mercury bond in calomel was established in the early 1900s. These advances were made possible by the development of reliable structural analysis tools, such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction.\\n\\nThe term \"cluster\" was used by F.A. Cotton in the early 1960s to refer specifically to compounds containing metal–metal bonds. \\n\\nCarbon clusters were first detected by Eric A. Rohlfing, Donald M. Cox, and Andrew Kaldor in 1984, in experiments where graphite was vaporized by laser and the vapor was quenched by a helium atmosphere.  Analysis of the condensed products with a  mass spectrometer revealed a preponderance of molecules with certain \"magic numbers\".  In 1985 their work was repeated by Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean O\\'Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley, who proposed the truncated icosahedron structure for the prominent C60 molecule, and proposed the name \"buckminsterfullerene\" for it.\\n\\nStructure and stability\\n\\nThe physical and chemical properties of atom clusters are very different from those of bulk solid with the same composition. The difference is due to the fact that a large fraction of their component atoms is found at their surface. For cluster cores with fewer than a couple dozen component atoms or molecules, the stable configurations usually have most or all atoms adjacent to the core\\'s surface, and thus only partially bound to other core elements.  \\n\\nA gradual transition occurs between the properties of the molecular species and those of the corresponding bulk mix with increasing number N of atoms in the core, since the fraction of atoms adjacent to its surface will scale approximately as N−1/3.  If N is 105, when the cluster can be considered a nanoparticle, only about 10% of the atoms in the core will be exposed at its surface.   That is still significant percentage, which is part of the reason why the properties of nanoparticles are still significantly different from those of the bulk substance.\\n\\nTransition metal clusters are frequently composed of refractory metal atoms. In general metal centers with extended d-orbitals form stable clusters because of favorable overlap of valence orbitals.  Thus, metals with a low oxidation state for the later metals and mid-oxidation states for the early metals tend to form stable clusters.  Polynuclear metal carbonyls are generally found in late transition metals with low formal oxidation states. The polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory or Wade\\'s electron counting rules predict trends in the stability and structures of many metal clusters. Jemmis mno rules have provided additional insight into the relative stability of metal clusters.\\n\\nGas-phase clusters and fullerenes\\nUnstable clusters can also be observed in the gas-phase by means of mass spectrometry, even though they may be thermodynamically unstable and aggregate easily upon condensation. Such naked clusters, i.e. those that are not stabilized by ligands, are often produced by laser induced evaporation - or ablation - of a bulk metal or metal-containing compound. Typically, this approach produces a broad distribution of size distributions. Their electronic structures can be interrogated by techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy, while infrared multiphoton dissociation spectroscopy is more probing the clusters geometry.  Their properties (Reactivity, Ionization potential, HOMO–LUMO-gap) often show a pronounced size dependence. Examples of such clusters are certain aluminium clusters as superatoms and certain gold clusters. Certain metal clusters are considered to exhibit metal aromaticity.  In some cases, the results of laser ablation experiments are translated to isolated compounds, and the premier cases are the clusters of carbon called the fullerenes, notably clusters with the formula C60, C70, and C84. The fullerene sphere can be filled with small molecules, forming Endohedral fullerenes.\\n\\nMajor families of cluster compounds\\n\\nThere is an infinite variety of compounds whose molecules are atom clusters or have such cluster at their core.  Below are some classes that have received substantial attention from researchers.\\n\\nMetallocarbohedrynes\\n\\nMetallocarbohedrynes (or met-car for short) are a family of clusters with  molecular formula , where M is a transition metal such as titanium, vanadium, zirconium, niobium, hafnium, molybdenum, chromium, or iron.  They can be  generated by vaporizing the desired metal with a laser, in an atmosphere containing the suitable hydrocarbon. They have been also detected, at a concentration of 1% or less, in the soot generated by an electric arc between two Ti-C electrodes. They feature metals atoms at the corners of a cube, but with the carbon atoms pushed inwards so as to be nearly coplanar with the faces of that cube.\\n\\nZintl clusters \\n\\nZintl compounds feature naked anionic clusters that are generated by reduction of heavy main group p elements, mostly metals or semimetals, with alkali metals, often as a solution in anhydrous liquid ammonia or ethylenediamine. Examples of Zintl anions are [Bi3]3−, [Sn9]4−, [Pb9]4−, and [Sb7]3−. Although these species are called \"naked clusters\", they are usually strongly associated with alkali metal cations. Some examples have been isolated using cryptate complexes of the alkali metal cation, e.g., [Pb10]2− anion, which features a capped square antiprismatic shape. According to Wade\\'s rules (2n+2) the number of cluster electrons is 22 and therefore a closo cluster. The compound is prepared from oxidation of K4Pb9  by Au+ in PPh3AuCl (by reaction of tetrachloroauric acid and triphenylphosphine) in ethylene diamine with 2.2.2-crypt. This type of cluster was already known as is the endohedral [Ni@Pb10]2− (the cage contains one nickel atom).  The icosahedral tin cluster [Sn12]2− or stannaspherene anion is another closed shell structure observed (but not isolated) with photoelectron spectroscopy. With an internal diameter of 6.1  Ångstrom, it is of comparable size to fullerene and should be capable of containing small atoms in the same manner as endohedral fullerenes, and indeed exists a Sn12 cluster that contains an Ir atom: [Ir@Sn12]3−.\\n\\nSee also\\nCluster (physics)\\n Water molecules form clusters as well: see water clusters\\nMetallaprism\\nPaolo Chini\\nMetal carbonyl cluster\\n\\nFurther reading (reviews)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n http://cluster-science.net - scientific community portal for clusters, fullerenes, nanotubes, nanostructures, and similar small systems\\n\\nCluster chemistry',\n",

It is a cyclic pentamer of ethylene oxide that forms complex with various cations, including sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), however, it is complementary to Na+ and thus has a higher selectivity for Na+ ions.\\n\\nSynthesis \\n15-Crown-5 can be synthesized using a modified Williamson ether synthesis:\\n\\n(CH2OCH2CH2Cl)2 + O(CH2CH2OH)2 + 2 NaOH → (CH2CH2O)5 + 2 NaCl + 2 H2O\\n\\nIt also forms from the cyclic oligomerization of ethylene oxide in the presence of gaseous boron trifluoride.\\n\\nProperties\\nAnalogous to 18-crown-6, 15-crown-5 binds to sodium ions.

       "       'Hapticity is the coordination of a ligand to a metal center via an uninterrupted and contiguous series of atoms. The hapticity of a ligand is described with the Greek letter η (\\'eta\\').  For example, η2 describes a ligand that coordinates through 2 contiguous atoms. In general the η-notation only applies when multiple atoms are coordinated (otherwise the κ-notation is used).  In addition, if the ligand coordinates through multiple atoms that are not contiguous then this is considered denticity (not hapticity), and the κ-notation is used once again.  When naming complexes care should be taken not to confuse η with μ (\\'mu\\'), which relates to bridging ligands.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe need for additional nomenclature for organometallic compounds became apparent in the mid-1950s when Dunitz, Orgel, and Rich described the structure of the \"sandwich complex\" ferrocene by X-ray crystallography where an iron atom is \"sandwiched\" between two parallel cyclopentadienyl rings. Cotton later proposed the term hapticity derived from the adjectival prefix hapto (from the Greek haptein, to fasten, denoting contact or combination) placed before the name of the olefin, where the Greek letter η (eta) is used to denote the number of contiguous atoms of a ligand that bind to a metal center. The term is usually employed to refer to ligands containing extended π-systems or where agostic bonding is not obvious from the formula.\\n\\nHistorically important compounds where the ligands are described with hapticity\\nFerrocene: bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)iron\\nUranocene: bis(η8-1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene)uranium\\nW(CO)3(PPri3)2(η2-H2): the first compound to be synthesized with a dihydrogen ligand.\\nIrCl(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2(η2-O2): the dioxygen derivative which forms reversibly upon oxygenation of Vaska\\'s complex.\\n\\nExamples\\nThe η-notation is encountered in many coordination compounds:\\nSide-on bonding of molecules containing σ-bonds like H2:\\nW(CO)3(PiPr3)2(η2-H2)\\nSide-on bonded ligands containing multiple bonded atoms, e.g. ethylene in Zeise\\'s salt or with fullerene, which is bonded through donation of the π-bonding electrons:\\nK[PtCl3(η2-C2H4)].H2O\\nRelated complexes containing bridging π-ligands:\\n(μ-η2:η2-C2H2)Co2(CO)6 and (Cp*2Sm)2(μ-η2:η2-N2)\\nDioxygen in bis{(trispyrazolylborato)copper(II)}(μ-η2:η2-O2),\\nNote that with some bridging ligands, an alternative bridging mode is observed, e.g. κ1,κ1, like in (Me3SiCH2)3V(μ-N2-κ1(N),κ1(N′))V(CH2SiMe3)3 contains a bridging dinitrogen molecule, where the molecule is end-on coordinated to the two metal centers (see hapticity vs. denticity).\\nThe bonding of π-bonded species can be extended over several atoms, e.g. in allyl, butadiene ligands, but also in cyclopentadienyl or benzene rings can share their electrons.\\nApparent violations of the 18-electron rule sometimes are explicable in compounds with unusual hapticities:\\nThe 18-VE complex (η5-C5H5)Fe(η1-C5H5)(CO)2 contains one η5 bonded cyclopentadienyl, and one η1 bonded cyclopentadienyl.\\nReduction of the 18-VE compound [Ru(η6-C6Me6)2]2+ (where both aromatic rings are bonded in an η6-coordination), results in another 18-VE compound: [Ru(η6-C6Me6)(η4-C6Me6)].\\nExamples of polyhapto coordinated heterocyclic and inorganic rings: Cr(η5-C4H4S)(CO)3 contains the sulfur heterocycle thiophene and Cr(η6-B3N3Me6)(CO)3 contains a coordinated inorganic ring (B3N3 ring).\\n\\nElectrons donated by \"π-ligands\" versus hapticity\\n\\nChanges in hapticity\\nThe hapticity of a ligand can change in the course of a reaction. E.g. in a redox reaction:\\n\\nHere one of the η6-benzene rings changes to a η4-benzene.\\n\\nSimilarly hapticity can change during a substitution reaction:\\n\\nHere the η5-cyclopentadienyl changes to an η3-cyclopentadienyl, giving room on the metal for an extra 2-electron donating ligand \\'L\\'. Removal of one molecule of CO and again donation of two more electrons by the cyclopentadienyl ligand restores the η5-cyclopentadienyl. The so-called indenyl effect also describes changes in hapticity in a substitution reaction.\\n\\nHapticity vs. denticity\\nHapticity must be distinguished from denticity. Polydentate ligands coordinate via multiple coordination sites within the ligand. In this case the coordinating atoms are identified using the κ-notation, as for example seen in coordination of 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2), to NiCl2 as dichloro[ethane-1,2-diylbis(diphenylphosphane)-κ2P]nickel(II). If the coordinating atoms are contiguous (connected to each other), the η-notation is used, as e.g. in titanocene dichloride: dichlorobis(η5-2,4-cyclopentadien-1-yl)titanium.\\n\\nHapticity and fluxionality\\nMolecules with polyhapto ligands are often fluxional, also known as stereochemically non-rigid. Two classes of fluxionality are prevalent for organometallic complexes of polyhapto ligands:\\nCase 1, typically: when the hapticity value is less than the number of sp2 carbon atoms. In such situations, the metal will often migrate from carbon to carbon, maintaining the same net hapticity. The η1-C5H5 ligand in (η5-C5H5)Fe( η1-C5H5)(CO)2 rearranges rapidly in solution such that Fe binds alternatingly to each carbon atom in the η1-C5H5 ligand. This reaction is degenerate and, in the jargon of organic chemistry, it is an example of a sigmatropic rearrangement.  A related example is Bis(cyclooctatetraene)iron, in which the η4- and η6-C8H8 rings interconvert.\\nCase 2, typically: complexes containing cyclic polyhapto ligands with maximized hapticity. Such ligands tend to rotate. A famous example is ferrocene, Fe(η5-C5H5)2, wherein the Cp rings rotate with a low energy barrier about the principal axis of the molecule that \"skewers\" each ring (see rotational symmetry). This \"ring torsion\" explains, inter alia, why only one isomer can be isolated for Fe(η5-C5H4Br)2 since the torsional barrier is very low.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCoordination chemistry',\n",
       "       'In the area of metal cluster chemistry, a butterfly cluster compound usually describes tetrametallic clusters containing five M-M bonds.  A prototype of this motif is [Re4(CO)12]2−. Most butterfly clusters have additional bridging ligands.  One example is the pentaphosphide [[Rh4(CO)5(PPh2)5]]− where all Rh---Rh edges are bridged by PPh2.  A carbide-containing butterfly cluster is [Fe4C(CO)12]2− where the carbide is bonded to all four Fe centers.\\n\\nBonding in such clusters is often discussed in the context of polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory.

Classified as an aza-crown ether, it is a white solid that is soluble in water. As a macrocyclic ligand, it binds strongly to many transition metal cations. The compound was first prepared by the reaction of 1,3-dibromopropane and ethylenediamine.\\n\\nThe compound features four secondary amines.  Its complexes therefore can exist as several diastereomers, depending on the relative orientation of the N–H centres. Its complexes feature alternating five- and six-membered chelate rings.  The closely related ligand cyclen ((CH2CH2NH)4) forms only five-membered C2N2M chelate rings and tends not to form square-planar complexes.\\n\\nN-Alkyl derivatives\\nMetal-cyclam complexes are prone to oxidative degradation, which is initiated by deprotonation of the secondary amine.  This flaw led to the development of cyclam derivatives wherein the NH centres are replaced by tertiary amines.  For example, the tetramethyl derivatives are readily prepared by methylation using formaldehyde and formic acid.

       "       'Charge-transfer bands are a characteristic feature of the optical spectra of many compounds.  These bands are typically more intense than d–d transitions.  They typically exhibit solvatochromism, consistent with shifts of electron density that would be sensitive to solvation.\\n\\nCT absorptions bands are intense and often lie in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the spectrum. For coordination complexes, charge-transfer bands often exhibit molar absorptivities, ε, of about 50000 L mol−1 cm−1.  By contrast ε values for d–d transitions are in the range of 20–200 L mol−1.  CT transitions are spin-allowed and Laporte-allowed. The weaker d–d transitions are potentially spin-allowed but always Laporte-forbidden.\\n\\nCharge-transfer bands of transition metal complexes result from shift of charge density between molecular orbitals (MO) that are predominantly metal in character and those that are predominantly ligand in character. If the transfer occurs from the MO with ligand-like character to the metal-like one, the transition is called a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT). If the electronic charge shifts from the MO with metal-like character to the ligand-like one, the band is called a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT). Thus, a MLCT results in oxidation of the metal center, whereas a LMCT results in the reduction of the metal center.\\n\\nCase studies\\n\\nIrBr63−/2-\\nThe optical spectrum of this d6 octahedral complex exhibits an intense absorption near 250\\xa0nm corresponding to a transition from ligand σ MO to the empty eg MO. In IrBr62−, which is a d5 complex, two absorptions, one near 600\\xa0nm and another near 270\\xa0nm, are observed. These are assigned as two LMCT bands, one to t2g and another to eg. The 600\\xa0nm band corresponds to transition to the t2g MO and the 270\\xa0nm band to the eg MO.\\n\\nCharge transfer bands may also arise from transfer of electrons from nonbonding orbitals of the ligand to the eg MO.\\n\\nd0 oxometallates\\n\\nThe tetraoxides of d0 metal centers are often deeply colored for the first row metals.  This coloration is assigned to LMCT, involving transfer of nonbonding electrons on the oxo ligands to empty d-levels on the metal.  For heavier metals, these same transitions occur in the UV region, hence no color is observed.  Hence perrhenate, tungstate, and molybdate are colorless.\\n\\nThe energies of transitions correlate with the order of the electrochemical series. The metal ions that are most easily reduced correspond to the lowest energy transitions. The above trend is consistent with transfer of electrons from the ligand to the metal, thus resulting in a reduction of metal ions by the ligand.\\n\\nPolypyridine complexes\\nComplexes of bipyridine, phenanthroline, and related unsaturated heterocycles often exhibit strong C-T bands. Most famous is Ru(bipy)32+, which upon irradiation gives excited states described as [Ru(III)(bipy−)(bipy)2]2+. The CT excited state is long-lived, allowing a rich chemistry ensues.\\n\\nMixed valence complexes\\n\\nIntervalence charge transfer (IVCT) is a type of charge-transfer band that is associated with mixed-valence compounds. Unlike the usual MLCT or LMCT bands, the IVCT bands are lower in energy, usually in the visible or near-infrared region of the spectrum and is broad.  Prussian blue, the blue pigment derived from Fe(III), Fe(II), and cyanide, owes its intense color to IVCT.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nChemical compounds',\n",

It is an open‐shell 67‐electron superatom.\\n\\nAt the time of its synthesis, it was the largest superatom to be synthesized. Its two distinct features are its large electron count compared to other heterometallic superatoms and its unprecedented electron structure of an open-shell configuration.\\n\\nThis is the very first example of a ligated heterometallic Mackay-type cluster, which is an extremely complex crystal structure whose surface is composed of two-shell 20 equilateral triangles composed of 55 copper and aluminum atoms. This shape is also called an icosahedron. The 43 copper and 12 aluminum atoms form a superatom by the metals forming a shared electron shell that resembles a single metal atom. Through magnetic data and analysis at the DFT level it shows that this superatom has a very unique electronic structure of the cluster which is a 67-electron open jellium shell [Cu43Al12]12+ core, protected by twelve Cp* ligands. These crystals have the chemical properties of individual copper atoms. They are attracted by a magnetic field, or paramagnetic due to three valence electrons in the outermost shell whose spin align themselves in a magnetic field.  Another property of this compound is that it is pyrophoric, or can ignite spontaneously when exposed to air, so it is highly sensitive to the air and moisture. Also, this compound cannot be re-dissolved in any solvent without decomposition, which means extensive characterization of the compound cannot be obtained with high-resolution mass spectrometry or solution NMR spectroscopy. Thus X-ray diffraction structural analysis of the data obtained does not meet the accepted high-quality requirements, due to the compound forming relatively small, weakly diffracting cubes when using single crystals.\\n\\nSynthesis\\nFischer's lab team designed the material by building compounds made of individual copper and aluminum atoms.

It is also a precursor protein for bradykinin.\\n\\nLow molecular weight kininogen \\nLow-molecular-weight-kininogen (LK) is mainly a precursor protein for kallidin.

TK is believed to be a biological indicator of senescence in rats, which can be measured by the level of endothelial cell production during the aging process.\\n\\nStructure \\nHK consists of 644 amino acid residues, which are separated into six different domains. Domains 1, 2, and 3 are called the “heavy chain” with Domains 2 and 3 having cysteine protease activity. Domains 5 and 6 are called the “light chain,” both of which bind specific molecules: Domain 5 binds heparin and zinc and selectively binds to anionic surfaces while Domain 6 binds prekallikrein, the protease precursor to plasma kallikrein. Domain 4 connects the heavy chain and light chain together, and its cleavage at this site releases bradykinin.   \\n\\nLK consists of 427 amino acid residues, which can also be separated into a “heavy chain” and a “light chain.\"\\n\\nT-kininogen consists of 430 amino acid residues.\\n\\nHK and LK are created by the alternative splicing of the same kininogen (KNG) gene, which in humans, is located at chromosome 3q27.

Factor XII is a zymogen, and upon binding with tissue to the anionic surface, exhibits some protease activity, starting the enzymatic cascade. Both the intrinsic and its corresponding extrinsic pathway, which is activated when outside trauma activates tissue factor (TF), an important glycoprotein, culminate in the activation of a serine protease called Factor X. Factor X is responsible for the conversion of prothrombin into an important protease in clotting called thrombin, which itself participates in the clotting cascade by activating more enzymes and proteins downstream in order to create even more thrombin. \\n\\nIn the kinin-kallikrein system, the proteolytic cleavage of HK by the enzyme plasma kallikrein makes bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator that can lower blood pressure by way of vasodilation.

       "       \"Kalirin, also known as Huntingtin-associated protein-interacting protein (HAPIP), protein duo (DUO), or serine/threonine-protein kinase with Dbl- and pleckstrin homology domain, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KALRN gene. Kalirin was first identified in 1997 as a protein interacting with huntingtin-associated protein 1. Is also known to play an important role in nerve growth and axonal development.\\n\\nKalirin is a member of the Dbl family of proteins and is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor.\\n\\nIt is named after the multiple-handed Hindu goddess Kali for its ability to interact with numerous other proteins. Kalirin's other name, DUO, comes from the fact that it is 98% identical to rat DUO protein and 80.6% identical to a human protein named TRIO. Unlike TRIO, which is expressed in numerous tissues, Kalirin isoforms are mainly found in the brain.\\n\\nClinical significance \\n\\nSeveral isoforms of Kalirin are produced through alternative splicing. One of the isoforms, Kalirin-7, was found to be necessary for the remodeling of synapses in mature cortical neurons and is thought to be important in the development of schizophrenia, as demonstrated by adolescent development of schizophrenia-like symptoms in kalirin knockout mice. Alzheimer's disease may also be linked to kalirin-7.\\n\\nThe KALRN gene, has been linked to multiple neurological disorders both through large exome and genome sequencing efforts, as well as post mortem and clinical studies.\\n\\nSeveral mutations within KALRN have been linked to neurological disease. In autism spectrum disorder a frameshift mutation was found  that is likely to lead to transcript decay, and heterozygosity. Another, found within the second GEF domain, is predicted to be highly deleterious to RhoA-GEF activity and likely affects the function of kalirin9 and 12 isoforms early in neuronal development. A patient harboring a homozygous mutation in kalirin’s spectrin repeat domain was found to have severe intellectual disability, and both truncating and missense mutations have been identified in patients with developmental delay. Several intronic variants have been associated with addiction and were found to alter the function of brain regions responsible for reward anticipation. This link to addiction is supported by animal models, where loss of kalirin results in altered cocaine self-administration and synaptic and expression changes in response to cocaine. Perhaps the most compelling genetic links are between kalirin and schizophrenia. Numerous missense mutations in KALRN have been identified in exome sequencing studies of schizophrenia cohorts  that are predicted to be deleterious to protein function.\\n\\nNeuronal studies have provided insight into the mechanisms of some missense mutations, particularly within the GEF domains of KALRN. A mutation found within the Rac-GEF domain was found to induce strong reductions in Rac activation, neuronal branching and spine density. These effects were mirrored by mutations in the RhoA-GEF domain, producing similar neuronal deficits, but by promoting RhoA-GEF activity. In addition to exome sequencing, post-mortem studies have consistently found alterations in kalirin transcript levels within the brain  further supporting a role for kalirin in the etiology of schizophrenia.\\n\\nIn addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, kalirin has been found to be underexpressed in the post-mortem Alzheimer’s brain. This loss of kalirin expression was recapitulated in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, introduction of kalirin7 into culture  or animal models  of Alzheimer’s disease was able to rescue synaptic and behavioral deficits, suggesting an important role for kalirin in regulating synapse loss and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.\\n\\nFunction \\nThe majority of kalirin’s effects are induced through its catalytic GEF domain signaling. By promoting the release of GDP from Rac and RhoA , it acts as an activator of GTPase signaling within the cell. Although able to activate Rac and RhoA, much of its activity in regulating neuronal morphology has been attributed to Rac-PAK pathway activation. kalirin has found been found to exert control over dendritic arborization, axonal growth, dendritic spine formation  and synaptic activity  and plasticity. These effects are regulated by protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications within the non-catalytic domains, and have been shown to exert control over kalirin subcellular targeting and activation.\\n\\nKalirin has been found to play a critical role in synaptic activity and plasticity. Loss of KALRN results in decreased nMDAr and AMPAr-mediated mEPSC, and kalirin7 knockout animals show strong deficits in NMDAr mediated long term potentiation  and long term depression. This may be linked to the ability to regulate RAC-PAK signaling and actin dynamics, which in turn can regulate the size and density of dendritic spines. Within dendritic spines, kalirin interacts with multiple disease related proteins to regulate synapse strength. It directly interacts with the schizophrenia risk factor DISC1 that can act to suppress kalirin function within the spine. Furthermore, kalirin7 directly interacts with the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor  and PSD95  within the post-synaptic density.\\n\\nThe importance of KALRN in neurodevelopment is supported by knockout animal models that display profound deficiencies in multiple behavioral tasks. Kalirin knockout animals display reduced GEF activity, dendritic arborization and spine density. These deficits may be linked to the observed reductions in prepulse inhibition, sociability and increased locomotor activity. Notably, loss of kalirin results in deficits in working memory, but not reference memory. The generation of a kalirin7 specific knockout animal model revealed similar deficits in spine density, suggesting a central role of kalirin7 in regulating neuronal connectivity. Both full and kalirin7 specific knockout animals show decreased anxiety-like behavior and impaired contextual fear learning.\\n\\nExpression \\nMultiple isoforms, arising from alternate splicing and promoter usage, display varying tissue and developmental expression. Control over kalirin expression is exerted through the use of alternate promoters which produce alternate start sites and restrict expression to specific neuronal subpopulations, and alter kalirin activity within neurons. During early development, the long kalirin9 and 12 isoforms are predominant in the brain. These isoforms contain both a Rac and a RhoA selective GEF domain, and control axonal growth and dendritic branching. Kalirin9 and 12 are also expressed ubiquitously throughout the body  and have functions outwith the brain. However, during neurodevelopment the kalirin7 isoform is preferentially expressed during periods of synaptogenesis, and this isoform displays highly restricted cortical expression. Kalirin7 expresses only the N-terminal domains, including the Rac-GEF domain along with a c-terminal PDZ-binding domain that strongly targets kalirin7 to the post-synaptic density. It is likely this subcellular distribution is vital to kalirin7 function, as this isoform exerts control dendritic spine density and synaptic plasticity. It is likely that mutations that result in deregulation of kalirin function within the brain is responsible for the role of kalirin within multiple neurological disorders.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n Traffic jam in brain causes schizophrenia symptoms\\n Architect of Synaptic Plasticity Links Spine Form and Function - Schizophrenia Research Forum, 2007-11-30\\n\\nEC 2.7.11\\nGTP-binding protein regulators\",\n",

       "       'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), also known as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), P-30 antigen, is a glycoprotein enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland.\\n\\nPSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely. It is also believed to be instrumental in dissolving cervical mucus, allowing the entry of sperm into the uterus.\\n\\nPSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate disorders. PSA is not uniquely an indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\\n\\nMedical uses\\n\\nProstate cancer\\n\\nScreening\\n\\nClinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial, in part due to uncertainty as to whether the benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient is required to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Health Service  does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor\\'s advice. The National Health Service does not offer general PSA screening, for similar reasons.\\n\\nPSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. \\n\\nWhile PSA testing may help 1 in 1,000 avoid death due to prostate cancer, 4 to 5 in 1,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. This means that PSA screening may reduce mortality from prostate cancer by up to 25%. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests.\\n\\nUse of PSA screening tests is also controversial due to questionable test accuracy. The screening can present abnormal results even when a man does not have cancer (known as a false-positive result), or normal results even when a man does have cancer (known as a false-negative result). False-positive test results can cause confusion and anxiety in men, and can lead to unnecessary prostate biopsies, a procedure which causes risk of pain, infection, and hemorrhage. False-negative results can give men a false sense of security even though they may actually have cancer.\\n\\nOf those found to have prostate cancer, overtreatment is common because most cases of prostate cancer are not expected to cause any symptoms due to low rate of growth of the prostate tumor. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, one will suffer pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and one perioperative death. Since the expected harm relative to risk of death are perceived by patients as minimal, men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) elect to receive treatment.\\n\\nRisk stratification and staging\\n\\nMen with prostate cancer may be characterized as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for having/developing metastatic disease or dying of prostate cancer. PSA level is one of three variables on which the risk-stratification is based; the others are the grade of prostate cancer (Gleason grading system) and the stage of cancer based on physical examination and imaging studies. D\\'Amico Criteria for each risk category are as follows:\\nLow-risk: PSA < 10, Gleason score ≤ 6, AND clinical stage ≤ T2a\\nIntermediate-risk: PSA 10-20, Gleason score 7, OR clinical stage T2b/c\\nHigh-risk: PSA > 20, Gleason score ≥ 8, OR clinical stage ≥ T3\\nGiven the relative simplicity of the 1998 D\\'Amico criteria (above), other predictive models of risk stratification based on mathematical probability constructs exist or have been proposed to allow for better matching of treatment decisions with disease features.\\nStudies are being conducted into the incorporation of multiparametric MRI imaging results into nomograms that rely on PSA, Gleason grade and tumor stage.\\n\\nPost-treatment monitoring\\n\\nPSA levels are monitored periodically (e.g., every 6–36 months) after treatment for prostate cancer – more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy (i.e., radical prostatectomy) is successful at removing all prostate tissue (and prostate cancer), PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.2ng/mL L is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign prostate tissue.\\n\\nFollowing radiation therapy of any type for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This makes it more difficult to interpret the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy. PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level is referred to as the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0ng/mL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.\\n\\nIf recurrent prostate cancer is detected by a rise in PSA levels after curative treatment, it is referred to as a \"biochemical recurrence\". The likelihood of developing recurrent prostate cancer after curative treatment is related to the pre-operative variables described in the preceding section (PSA level and grade/stage of cancer). Low-risk cancers are the least likely to recur, but they are also the least likely to have required treatment in the first place.\\n\\nHistology\\n\\nPSA is produced in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using immunohistochemistry. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and is the cause of elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.\\n\\nMore significantly, PSA remains present in prostate cells after they become malignant. Prostate cancer cells generally have variable or weak staining for PSA, due to the disruption of their normal functioning. Thus, individual prostate cancer cells produce less PSA than healthy cells; the raised serum levels in prostate cancer patients is due to the greatly increased number of such cells, not their individual activity. However, in most cases of prostate cancer, the cells remain positive for the antigen, which can therefore be used to identify metastasis. Since some high-grade prostate cancers may be entirely negative for PSA, however, histological analysis to identify such cases usually uses PSA in combination with other antibodies, such as PSAP and CD57.\\n\\nForensic identification of semen\\n\\nPSA was first identified by researchers attempting to find a substance in seminal fluid that would aid in the investigation of rape cases. PSA is now used to indicate the presence of semen in forensic serology. The semen of adult males has PSA levels far in excess of those found in other tissues; therefore, a high level of PSA found in a sample is an indicator that semen may be present. Because PSA is a biomarker that is expressed independently of spermatozoa, it remains useful in identifying semen from vasectomized and azoospermic males.\\n\\nPSA can also be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum threshold of interpretation to rule out false positive results and conclusively state that semen is present. While traditional tests such as crossover electrophoresis have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical prostate cancer screening methods have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4ng/mL. This level of antigen has been shown to be present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk.\\n\\nNo studies have been performed to assess the PSA levels in the tissues and secretions of pre-pubescent children. Therefore, the presence of PSA from a high sensitivity (4ng/mL) test cannot conclusively identify the presence of semen, so care must be taken with the interpretation of such results.\\n\\nMechanism of action \\nThe physiological function of KLK3 is the dissolution of the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate, it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive.\\n\\nFurther regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well-regulated manner.\\n\\nBiochemistry \\n\\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA, also known as kallikrein III, seminin, semenogelase, γ-seminoprotein and P-30 antigen) is a 34-kD glycoprotein produced almost exclusively by the prostate gland. It is a serine protease () enzyme, the gene of which is located on the 19th chromosome (19q13) in humans.\\n\\nHistory \\n\\nThe discovery of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is beset with controversy; as PSA is present in prostatic tissue and semen, it was independently discovered and given different names, thus adding to the controversy.\\n\\nFlocks was the first to experiment with antigens in the prostate and 10 years later Ablin reported the presence of precipitation antigens in the prostate.\\n\\nIn 1971, Mitsuwo Hara characterized a unique protein in the semen fluid, gamma-seminoprotein. Li and Beling, in 1973, isolated a protein, E1, from human semen in an attempt to find a novel method to achieve fertility control.\\n\\nIn 1978, Sensabaugh identified semen-specific protein p30, but proved that it was similar to E1 protein, and that prostate was the source. In 1979, Wang purified a tissue-specific antigen from the prostate (\\'prostate antigen\\').\\n\\nPSA was first measured quantitatively in the blood by Papsidero in 1980, and Stamey carried out the initial work on the clinical use of PSA as a marker of prostate cancer.\\n\\nSerum levels\\n\\nPSA is normally present in the blood at very low levels. The reference range of less than 4ng/mL for the first commercial PSA test, the Hybritech Tandem-R PSA test released in February 1986, was based on a study that found 99% of 472 apparently healthy men had a total PSA level below 4ng/mL.\\n\\nIncreased levels of PSA may suggest the presence of prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer can also be present in the complete absence of an elevated PSA level, in which case the test result would be a false negative.\\n\\nObesity has been reported to reduce serum PSA levels. Delayed early detection may partially explain worse outcomes in obese men with early prostate cancer. After treatment, higher BMI also correlates to higher risk of recurrence.\\n\\nPSA levels can be also increased by prostatitis, irritation, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and recent ejaculation, producing a false positive result. Digital rectal examination (DRE) has been shown in several studies to produce an increase in PSA. However, the effect is clinically insignificant, since DRE causes the most substantial increases in patients with PSA levels already elevated over 4.0ng/mL.\\n\\nThe \"normal\" reference ranges for prostate-specific antigen increase with age, as do the usual ranges in cancer, as per table below.\\n\\nPSA velocity\\n\\nDespite earlier findings, recent research suggests that the rate of increase of PSA (e.g. >0.35ng/mL/yr, the \\'PSA velocity\\') is not a more specific marker for prostate cancer than the serum level of PSA.\\n\\nHowever, the PSA rate of rise may have value in prostate cancer prognosis. Men with prostate cancer whose PSA level increased by more than 2.0ng per milliliter during the year before the diagnosis of prostate cancer have a higher risk of death from prostate cancer despite undergoing radical prostatectomy. PSA velocity (PSAV) was found in a 2008 study to be more useful than the PSA doubling time (PSA DT) to help identify those men with life-threatening disease before start of treatment.\\n\\nMen who are known to be at risk for prostate cancer, and who decide to plot their PSA values as a function of time (i.e., years), may choose to use a semi-log plot. An exponential growth in PSA values appears as a straight line on a semi-log plot, so that a new PSA value significantly above the straight line signals a switch to a new and significantly higher growth rate, i.e., a higher PSA velocity.\\n\\nFree PSA\\n\\nMost PSA in the blood is bound to serum proteins. A small amount is not protein-bound and is called \\'free PSA\\'. In men with prostate cancer, the ratio of free (unbound) PSA to total PSA is decreased. The risk of cancer increases if the free to total ratio is less than 25%. (See graph at right.) The lower the ratio is, the greater the probability of prostate cancer. Measuring the ratio of free to total PSA appears to be particularly promising for eliminating unnecessary biopsies in men with PSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL. However, both total and free PSA increase immediately after ejaculation, returning slowly to baseline levels within 24 hours.\\n\\nInactive PSA\\n\\nThe PSA test in 1994 failed to differentiate between prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and the commercial assay kits for PSA did not provide correct PSA values. Thus with the introduction of the ratio of free-to-total PSA, the reliability of the test has improved. Measuring the activity of the enzyme could add to the ratio of free-to-total PSA and further improve the diagnostic value of test. Proteolytically active PSA has been shown to have an anti-angiogenic effect  and certain inactive subforms may be associated with prostate cancer, as shown by MAb 5D3D11, an antibody able to detect forms abundantly represented in sera from cancer patients.\\nThe presence of inactive proenzyme forms of PSA is another potential indicator of disease.\\n\\nComplexed PSA\\n\\nPSA exists in serum in the free (unbound) form and in a complex with alpha 1-antichymotrypsin; research has been conducted to see if measurements of complexed PSA are more specific and sensitive biomarkers for prostate cancer than other approaches.\\n\\nPSA in other biologic fluids and tissues\\n\\nIt is now clear that the term prostate-specific antigen is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.\\n\\nIn women, PSA is found in female ejaculate at concentrations roughly equal to that found in male semen. Other than semen and female ejaculate, the greatest concentrations of PSA in biological fluids are detected in breast milk and amniotic fluid. Low concentrations of PSA have been identified in the urethral glands, endometrium, normal breast tissue and salivary gland tissue. PSA also is found in the serum of women with breast, lung, or uterine cancer and in some patients with renal cancer.\\n\\nTissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA in order to determine the origin of malignant cells that have metastasized.\\n\\nInteractions \\n\\nProstate-specific antigen has been shown to interact with protein C inhibitor.\\nProstate-specific antigen interacts with and activates the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are involved in tumor angiogenesis and in the lymphatic metastasis of tumors.\\n\\nSee also \\n Tumor markers\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nExternal links \\n The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: S01.162\\n American Cancer Society: Detailed Guide: Prostate Cancer Can Prostate Cancer Be Found Early?\\n National Cancer Institute: The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test: Questions and Answers\\n \\n Prostate UK Help us stop prostate diseases ruining lives\\n PSA at Lab Tests Online\\n Total PSA ELISA assay procedure\\n \\n\\nAndrology\\nBiomarkers\\nBlood tests\\nEC 3.4.21\\nProstate cancer\\nTumor markers\\nUrology',\n",

Plasma prekallikrein is converted to plasma kallikrein by factor XIIa by the cleavage of an internal Arg-Ile bond.  Plasma kallikrein therefore is composed of a heavy chain and a light chain held together by a disulfide bond.  The heavy chain originates from the amino-terminal end of the zymogen and contains 4 tandem repeats of 90 or 91 amino acids.  Each repeat harbors a novel structure called the apple domain.  The heavy chain is required for the surface-dependent pro-coagulant activity of plasma kallikrein.

       "       \"The kinin–kallikrein system or simply kinin system is a poorly understood hormonal system with limited available research. It consists of blood proteins that play a role in inflammation, blood pressure control, coagulation and pain. Its important mediators bradykinin and kallidin are vasodilators and act on many cell types. Clinical symptoms include marked weakness, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis and acceleration of ESR.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe system was discovered in 1909 when researchers discovered that injection with urine (high in kinins) led to hypotension (low blood pressure). The researchers Emil Karl Frey, Heinrich Kraut and Eugen Werle discovered high-molecular weight kininogen in urine around 1930.\\n\\nEtymology\\nkinin [Gk] kīn(eîn) to move, set in motion. kallikrein [Gk ] kalli~ sweet and krein = kreos, flesh, named for the pancreatic extracts where it was first discovered\\n\\nMembers\\nThe system consists of a number of large proteins, some small polypeptides and a group of enzymes that activate and deactivate the compounds.\\n\\nProteins\\nHigh-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low-molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) are precursors of the polypeptides. They have no activity of themselves.\\n HMWK is produced by the liver together with prekallikrein (see below). It acts mainly as a cofactor on coagulation and inflammation, and has no intrinsic catalytic activity.\\n LMWK is produced locally by numerous tissues, and secreted together with tissue kallikrein.\\n\\nPolypeptides\\n Bradykinin (BK), which acts on the B2 receptor and slightly on B1, is produced when kallikrein releases it from HMWK. It is a nonapeptide (9 amino acids) with the amino acid sequence Arg–Pro–Pro–Gly–Phe–Ser–Pro–Phe–Arg.\\n Kallidin (KD) is released from LMWK by tissue kallikrein. It is a decapeptide. KD has the same amino acid sequence as Bradykinin with the addition of a Lysine at the N-terminus, thus is sometimes referred to as Lys-Bradykinin.\\n\\nHMWK and LMWK are formed by alternative splicing of the same gene.\\n\\nEnzymes\\n  Kallikreins (tissue and plasma kallikrein) are serine proteases that liberate kinins (BK and KD) from the kininogens, which are plasma proteins that are converted into vasoactive peptides. Prekallikrein is the precursor of plasma kallikrein. It can only activate kinins after being activated itself by factor XIIa or other stimuli.\\n Carboxypeptidases are present in two forms: N circulates and M is membrane-bound. They remove arginine residues at the carboxy-terminus of BK and KD.\\n Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), also termed kininase II, inactivates a number of peptide mediators, including bradykinin. It is better known for activating angiotensin.\\n Neutral endopeptidase also deactivates kinins and other mediators.\\n\\nPharmacology\\nInhibition of ACE with ACE inhibitors leads to decreased conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) but also to an increase in bradykinin due to decreased degradation. This explains why some patients taking ACE inhibitors develop a dry cough, and some react with angioedema, a dangerous swelling of the head and neck region.\\n\\nThere are hypotheses that many of the ACE-inhibitors' beneficial effects are due to their influence on the kinin-kallikrein system. This includes their effects in arterial hypertension, in ventricular remodeling (after myocardial infarction) and possibly diabetic nephropathy.\\n\\nRole in disease\\nDefects of the kinin-kallikrein system in diseases are not generally recognized. The system is the subject of much research due to its relationship to the inflammation and blood pressure systems. It is known that kinins are inflammatory mediators that cause dilation of blood vessels and increased vascular permeability. Kinins are small peptides produced from kininogen by kallikrein and are broken down by kininases. They act on phospholipase and increase arachidonic acid release and thus prostaglandin (PGE2) production.\\n\\nC1-INH Involvement\\nC1-inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) protein. C1-INH is the most important physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, fXIa and fXIIa. C1-INH also inhibits proteinases of the fibrinolytic, clotting, and kinin pathways.

       "       'Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases, enzymes capable of cleaving peptide bonds in proteins. In humans, plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) has no known paralogue, while tissue kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) encode a family of fifteen closely related serine proteases. These genes are localised to chromosome 19q13, forming the largest contiguous cluster of proteases within the human genome. Kallikreins are responsible for the coordination of various physiological functions including blood pressure, semen liquefaction and skin desquamation.\\n\\nOccurrence\\n\\nIn 1934, Eugen Werle reported finding a substance in the pancreas of humans and various animals in such large amounts that the pancreas could be taken for its site of origin. He named it kallikrein, by derivation from the Greek word for pancreas. Since then, similar enzymes have been found in the biological fluids of humans and other mammals, as well as in some snake venoms.\\n\\nVenom\\nThe caterpillar known as Lagoa crispata contains poison glands attached to hypodermic spines, which produce and inject venom that has been characterized as kallikrein in nature.\\n\\nThe venom of solenodons and some shrews like the northern short-tailed shrew consist of multiple, independently-evolved paralogous kallikrein 1 (KLK1) serine proteases, which cause hypotensive effects in vivo.\\n\\nPlasma kallikrein\\nThe KLKB1 gene encoding plasma kallikrein is located on chromosome 4q34-35. It is synthesised as an inactive precursor, prekallikrein, which must undergo proteolytic processing to become activated. This is facilitated by factor XII, PRCP or other stimuli.\\n\\nPlasma kallikrein liberates kinins (bradykinin and kallidin) from the kininogens, peptides responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and activation of inflammation. It is also capable of generating plasmin from plasminogen:\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nKallikrein is homologous to factor XI and consists of four apple domains and one serine protease domain.\\n\\nTissue kallikreins\\n\\nDistinct from plasma kallikrein, tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are expressed throughout the human body and perform various physiological roles. As some kallikreins are able to catalyse the activation of other kallikreins, several cascades involving these proteases have been implicated in the regulation of homeostatic functions.\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nSimilar to KLKB1, three tissue kallikreins KLK1, KLK2 and KLK12 also participate in regulation of blood pressure via the activation of bradykinin. KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK5 and KLK14 are expressed in the prostate and are thought to be responsible for regulating semen liquefaction through hydrolysis of semenogelin. Desquamation of the skin is likely controlled by KLK5, KLK7 and KLK14, which are expressed in the outermost layer of the epidermis and cleave cellular adhesion proteins. Additionally, KLK6 and KLK8 are associated with neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system.\\n\\nGenes\\nThere are 15 known human tissue kallikreins: KLK1, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK9, KLK10, KLK11, KLK12, KLK13, KLK14, KLK15\\n\\nClinical significance\\nKallikrein-related peptidases are targets of active investigation by drug researchers as possible biomarkers for cancer.\\n\\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA; hk3, human kallikrein gene 3) and human glandular kallikrein (hK2) are used as tumor markers for prostate cancer.\\n\\nEcallantide, lanadelumab, and berotralstat are FDA-approved drugs that inhibit kallikrein and can be used for managing Hereditary Angioedema.\\n\\nSee also\\n Prekallikrein\\n Kinin-kallikrein system\\n Kinin\\n Aprotinin\\n List of cutaneous conditions\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: S01.212\\n \\n\\nEC 3.4.21\\nKinin–kallikrein system\\nUrticaria and angioedema'],\n",

Shortly afterwards he used it to simplify the Walter theorem on groups with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups , and Gorenstein and Walter's classification of groups with dihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. Bender's method involves studying a maximal subgroup M containing the centralizer of an involution, and its generalized Fitting subgroup F*(M).\\n\\nOne succinct version of Bender's method is the result that if M, N are two distinct maximal subgroups of a simple group with F*(M) ≤ N and F*(N) ≤ M, then there is a prime p such that both F*(M) and F*(N) are p-groups.  This situation occurs whenever M and N are distinct maximal parabolic subgroups of a simple group of Lie type, and in this case p is the characteristic, but this has only been used to help identify groups of low Lie rank.

       "       'In the mathematical subject of geometric group theory, a Dehn function, named after Max Dehn, is an optimal function associated to a finite group presentation which bounds the area of a relation in that group (that is a freely reduced word in the generators representing the identity element of the group) in terms of the length of that relation (see pp.\\xa079–80 in ). The growth type of the Dehn function is a  quasi-isometry invariant of a finitely presented group. The Dehn function of a finitely presented group is also closely connected with non-deterministic algorithmic complexity of the word problem in groups. In particular, a finitely presented group has solvable word problem if and only if the Dehn function for a finite presentation of this group is recursive (see Theorem 2.1 in ). The notion of a Dehn function is motivated by isoperimetric problems in geometry, such as the classic isoperimetric inequality for the Euclidean plane and, more generally, the notion of a filling area function that estimates the area of a minimal surface in a Riemannian manifold in terms of the length of the boundary curve of that surface.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe idea of an isoperimetric function for a finitely presented group goes back to the work of Max Dehn in 1910s. Dehn proved that the word problem for the standard presentation of the fundamental group of a closed oriented surface of genus at least two is solvable by what is now called Dehn\\'s algorithm. A direct consequence of this fact is that for this presentation the Dehn function satisfies Dehn(n) ≤ n. This result was extended in 1960s by Martin Greendlinger to finitely presented groups satisfying the C\\'(1/6) small cancellation condition. The formal notion of an isoperimetric function and a Dehn function as it is used today appeared in late 1980s – early 1990s together with the introduction and development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups. In his 1987 monograph \"Hyperbolic groups\" Gromov proved that a finitely presented group is word-hyperbolic if and only if it satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality, that is, if and only if the Dehn function of this group is equivalent to the function f(n) = n. Gromov\\'s proof was in large part informed by analogy with filling area functions for compact Riemannian manifolds where the area of a minimal surface bounding a null-homotopic closed curve is bounded in terms of the length of that curve.\\n\\nThe study of isoperimetric and Dehn functions quickly developed into a separate major theme in geometric group theory, especially since the growth types of these functions are natural quasi-isometry invariants of finitely presented groups. One of the major results in the subject was obtained by Sapir, Birget and Rips who showed that most \"reasonable\" time complexity functions of Turing machines can be realized, up to natural equivalence, as Dehn functions of finitely presented groups.\\n\\nFormal definition\\n\\nLet\\n\\nbe a finite group presentation where the X is a finite alphabet and where R\\xa0⊆\\xa0F(X) is a finite set of cyclically reduced words.\\n\\nArea of a relation\\n\\nLet w\\xa0∈\\xa0F(X) be a relation in G, that is, a freely reduced word such that w\\xa0=\\xa01 in G. Note that this is equivalent to saying that w belongs to the normal closure of R in F(X), that is, there exists a representation of w as\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(♠)\\n\\nwhere m\\xa0≥\\xa00 and where ri\\xa0∈\\xa0R± 1 for i\\xa0=\\xa01,\\xa0...,\\xa0m.\\n\\nFor w\\xa0∈\\xa0F(X) satisfying w\\xa0=\\xa01 in G, the area of w with respect to (∗), denoted Area(w), is the smallest m\\xa0≥\\xa00 such that there exists a representation (♠) for w as the product in F(X) of m conjugates of elements of R± 1.\\n\\nA freely reduced word w\\xa0∈\\xa0F(X) satisfies w\\xa0=\\xa01 in G if and only if the loop labeled by w in the presentation complex for G corresponding to (∗) is null-homotopic. This fact can be used to show that Area(w) is the smallest number of 2-cells in a van Kampen diagram over (∗) with boundary cycle labelled by w.\\n\\nIsoperimetric function\\n\\nAn isoperimetric function for a finite presentation (∗) is a monotone non-decreasing function\\n\\nsuch that whenever w\\xa0∈\\xa0F(X) is a freely reduced word satisfying w\\xa0=\\xa01 in G, then\\nArea(w)\\xa0≤\\xa0f(|w|),\\nwhere |w| is the length of the word w.\\n\\nDehn function\\nThen the Dehn function of a finite presentation (∗) is defined as\\n\\nEquivalently, Dehn(n) is the smallest isoperimetric function for (∗), that is, Dehn(n) is an isoperimetric function for (∗) and for any other isoperimetric function f(n) we have\\nDehn(n)\\xa0≤\\xa0f(n)\\nfor every n\\xa0≥\\xa00.\\n\\nGrowth types of functions\\n\\nBecause Dehn functions are usually difficult to compute precisely, one usually studies their asymptotic growth types as n tends to infinity.\\n\\nFor two monotone-nondecreasing functions \\n\\none says that f is dominated by g if there exists C\\xa0≥1 such that\\n\\nfor every integer n\\xa0≥\\xa00. Say that f\\xa0≈\\xa0g if f is dominated by g and g is dominated by f. Then ≈ is an equivalence relation and Dehn functions and isoperimetric functions are usually studied up to this equivalence relation. \\nThus for any a,b\\xa0>\\xa01 we have an\\xa0≈\\xa0bn. Similarly, if f(n) is a polynomial of degree d (where d\\xa0≥\\xa01 is a real number) with non-negative coefficients, then f(n)\\xa0≈\\xa0nd. Also, 1\\xa0≈\\xa0n.\\n\\nIf a finite group presentation admits an isoperimetric function f(n) that is equivalent to a linear (respectively, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, exponential, etc.) function in n, the presentation is said to satisfy a linear (respectively, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, exponential, etc.) isoperimetric inequality.\\n\\nBasic properties\\nIf G and H are quasi-isometric finitely presented groups and some finite presentation of G has an isoperimetric function f(n) then for any finite presentation of H there is an isoperimetric function equivalent to f(n). In particular, this fact holds for G\\xa0=\\xa0H, where the same group is given by two different finite presentations. \\nConsequently, for a finitely presented group the growth type of its Dehn function, in the sense of the above definition, does not depend on the choice of a finite presentation for that group. More generally, if two finitely presented groups are quasi-isometric then their Dehn functions are equivalent.\\nFor a finitely presented group G given by a finite presentation (∗) the following conditions are equivalent:\\nG has a recursive Dehn function with respect to (∗).\\nThere exists a recursive isoperimetric function f(n) for (∗).\\nThe group G has solvable word problem.\\nIn particular, this implies that solvability of the word problem is a quasi-isometry invariant for finitely presented groups.\\nKnowing the area Area(w) of a relation w allows to bound, in terms of |w|, not only the number of conjugates of the defining relations in (♠) but the lengths of the conjugating elements ui as well. As a consequence, it is known that if a finitely presented group G given by a finite presentation (∗) has computable Dehn function Dehn(n), then the word problem for G is solvable with non-deterministic time complexity Dehn(n) and deterministic time complexity Exp(Dehn(n)). However, in general there is no reasonable bound on the Dehn function of a finitely presented group in terms of the deterministic time complexity of the word problem and the gap between the two functions can be quite large.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nFor any finite presentation of a finite group G we have Dehn(n)\\xa0≈\\xa0n.\\nFor the closed oriented surface of genus 2, the standard presentation of its fundamental group\\n\\nsatisfies Dehn(n)\\xa0≤\\xa0n and Dehn(n)\\xa0≈\\xa0n.\\nFor every integer k\\xa0≥\\xa02 the free abelian group  has Dehn(n)\\xa0≈\\xa0n2.\\nThe Baumslag-Solitar group\\n \\nhas Dehn(n)\\xa0≈\\xa02n (see ).\\nThe 3-dimensional discrete Heisenberg group\\n\\nsatisfies a cubic but no quadratic isoperimetric inequality.\\nHigher-dimensional Heisenberg groups\\n,\\nwhere k\\xa0≥\\xa02, satisfy quadratic isoperimetric inequalities.\\nIf G is a \"Novikov-Boone group\", that is, a finitely presented group with unsolvable word problem, then the Dehn function of G growths faster than any recursive function.\\nFor the Thompson group F the Dehn function is quadratic, that is, equivalent to n2 (see ).\\nThe so-called Baumslag-Gersten group\\n\\nhas a Dehn function growing faster than any fixed iterated tower of exponentials.

Moreover, every finitely generated nilpotent group G admits a polynomial isoperimetric inequality of degree c\\xa0+\\xa01, where c is the nilpotency class of G.\\nThe set of real numbers d\\xa0≥\\xa01, such that there exists a finitely presented group with Dehn function equivalent to nd, is dense in the interval .\\nIf all asymptotic cones of a finitely presented group are simply connected, then the group satisfies a polynomial isoperimetric inequality.\\nIf a finitely presented group satisfies a quadratic isoperimetric inequality, then all asymptotic cones of this group are simply connected.\\nIf (M,g) is a closed Riemannian manifold and G\\xa0=\\xa0π1(M) then the Dehn function of G is equivalent to the filling area function of the manifold.\\nIf G is a group acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly by isometries on a CAT(0) space, then G satisfies a quadratic isoperimetric inequality. In particular, this applies to the case where G is the fundamental group of a closed Riemannian manifold of non-positive sectional curvature (not necessarily constant).\\nThe Dehn function of SL(m, Z) is at most exponential for any m\\xa0≥\\xa03. For SL(3,Z) this bound is sharp and it is known in that case that the Dehn function does not admit a subexponential upper bound. The Dehn functions for SL(m,Z), where m\\xa0>\\xa04 are quadratic.  The Dehn function of SL(4,Z), has been conjectured to be quadratic, by Thurston.\\nMapping class groups of surfaces of finite type are automatic and satisfy quadratic isoperimetric inequalities.\\nThe Dehn functions for the groups Aut(Fk) and Out(Fk) are exponential for every  k ≥ 3. Exponential isoperimetric inequalities for Aut(Fk) and Out(Fk) when k ≥ 3 were found by Hatcher and Vogtmann. These bounds are sharp, and the groups Aut(Fk) and Out(Fk) do not satisfy subexponential isoperimetric inequalities, as shown for k\\xa0=\\xa03 by Bridson and Vogtmann, and for k ≥ 4 by Handel and Mosher. \\nFor every automorphism φ of a finitely generated free group Fk the mapping torus group  of φ satisfies a quadratic isoperimetric inequality.\\nMost \"reasonable\" computable functions that are ≥n4, can be realized, up to equivalence, as Dehn functions of finitely presented groups. In particular, if f(n)\\xa0≥\\xa0n4 is a superadditive function whose binary representation is computable in time  by a Turing machine then f(n) is equivalent to the Dehn function of a finitely presented group.\\nAlthough one cannot reasonably bound the Dehn function of a group in terms of the complexity of its word problem, Birget, Olʹshanskii, Rips and Sapir obtained the following result, providing a far-reaching generalization of Higman\\'s embedding theorem: The word problem of a finitely generated group is decidable in nondeterministic polynomial time if and only if this group can be embedded into a finitely presented group with a polynomial isoperimetric function. Moreover, every group with the word problem solvable in time T(n) can be embedded into a group with isoperimetric function equivalent to n2T(n2)4.\\n\\nGeneralizations\\n\\nThere are several companion notions closely related to the notion of an isoperimetric function. Thus an isodiametric function bounds the smallest diameter (with respect to the simplicial metric where every edge has length one) of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. A filling length function the smallest filling length of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. Here the filling length of a diagram is the minimum, over all combinatorial null-homotopies of the diagram, of the maximal length of intermediate loops bounding intermediate diagrams along such null-homotopies. The filling length function is closely related to the non-deterministic space complexity of the word problem for finitely presented groups. There are several general inequalities connecting the Dehn function, the optimal isodiametric function and the optimal filling length function, but the precise relationship between them is not yet understood.\\nThere are also higher-dimensional generalizations of isoperimetric and Dehn functions. For k\\xa0≥\\xa01 the k-dimensional isoperimetric function of a group bounds the minimal combinatorial volume of (k\\xa0+\\xa01)-dimensional ball-fillings of k-spheres mapped into a k-connected space on which the group acts properly and cocompactly; the bound is given as a function of the combinatorial volume of the k-sphere. The standard notion of an isoperimetric function corresponds to the case k\\xa0=\\xa01. Unlike the case of standard Dehn functions, little is known about possible growth types of k-dimensional isoperimetric functions of finitely presented groups for k\\xa0≥\\xa02.\\nIn his monograph Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups Gromov proposed a probabilistic or averaged version of Dehn function and suggested that for many groups averaged Dehn functions should have strictly slower asymptotics than the standard Dehn functions. More precise treatments of the notion of an averaged Dehn function or mean Dehn function were given later by other researchers who also proved that indeed averaged Dehn functions are subasymptotic to standard Dehn functions in a number of cases (such as nilpotent and abelian groups).\\n\\nA relative version of the notion of an isoperimetric function plays a central role in Osin\\' approach to relatively hyperbolic groups.\\nGrigorchuk and Ivanov  explored several natural generalizations of Dehn function for group presentations on finitely many generators but with infinitely many defining relations.\\n\\nSee also\\nvan Kampen diagram\\nWord-hyperbolic group\\nAutomatic group\\nSmall cancellation theory\\nGeometric group theory\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nFurther reading\\nNoel Brady, Tim Riley and Hamish Short.

In case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words and in the case of free product of groups these are reduced sequences. The precise definitions of these are given below. As it turns out, for a free group and for the free product of groups, there exists a unique normal form i.e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique.

       "       'A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves some of the group structure (the rest of the structure is \"factored\" out).  For example, the cyclic group of addition modulo n can be obtained from the group of integers under addition by identifying elements that differ by a multiple of n and defining a group structure that operates on each such class (known as a congruence class) as a single entity. It is part of the mathematical field known as group theory.\\n\\nFor a congruence relation on a group, the equivalence class of the identity element is always a normal subgroup of the original group, and the other equivalence classes are precisely the cosets of that normal subgroup.  The resulting quotient is written , where G is the original group and N is the normal subgroup.  (This is pronounced \"G mod N\", where \"mod\" is short for modulo.)\\n\\nMuch of the importance of quotient groups is derived from their relation to homomorphisms.  The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of any group G under a homomorphism is always isomorphic to a quotient of G.  Specifically, the image of G under a homomorphism  is isomorphic to  where ker(φ) denotes the kernel of φ.\\n\\nThe dual notion of a quotient group is a subgroup, these being the two primary ways of forming a smaller group from a larger one. Any normal subgroup has a corresponding quotient group, formed from the larger group by eliminating the distinction between elements of the subgroup. In category theory, quotient groups are examples of quotient objects, which are dual to subobjects.\\n\\nDefinition and illustration\\nGiven a group G and a subgroup H, and an element a ∈ G, one can consider the corresponding left coset: aH := { ah : h ∈ H }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group G of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup H of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: 0 + H, which are the even integers, and 1 + H, which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation).\\n\\nFor a general subgroup H, it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { aH : a ∈ G }. This is possible exactly when H is a normal subgroup, see below. A subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if the coset equality aN = Na holds for all a ∈ G. A normal subgroup of G is denoted .\\n\\nDefinition\\nLet N be a normal subgroup of a group G. Define the set G/N to be the set of all left cosets of N in G. That is, . Since the identity element e ∈ N, a ∈ aN. Define a binary operation on the set of cosets, G/N, as follows. For each aN and bN in G/N, the product of aN and bN, (aN)(bN), is (ab)N. This works only because (ab)N does not depend on the choice of the representatives, a and b, of each left coset, aN and bN. To prove this, suppose xN = aN and yN = bN for some x, y, a, b ∈ G. Then\\n\\n(ab)N = a(bN) = a(yN) = a(Ny) = (aN)y = (xN)y = x(Ny) = x(yN) = (xy)N.\\n\\nThis depends on the fact that N is a normal subgroup. It still remains to be shown that this condition is not only sufficient but necessary to define the operation on G/N.\\n\\nTo show that it is necessary, consider that for a subgroup N of G, we have been given that the operation is well defined. That is, for all xN = aN and yN = bN, for x, y, a, b ∈ G, (ab)N = (xy)N.\\n\\nLet n ∈ N and g ∈ G. Since eN = nN, we have, gN = (eg)N = (ng)N.\\n\\nNow, gN = (ng)N ⇔ N = g−1(ng)N ⇔ g−1ng ∈ N ∀ n ∈ N and g ∈ G.\\n\\nHence N is a normal subgroup of G.\\n\\nIt can also be checked that this operation on G/N is always associative. G/N has identity element N and the inverse of element aN can always be represented by a−1N. Therefore, the set G/N together with the operation defined by (aN)(bN) = (ab)N forms a group, the quotient group of G by N.\\n\\nDue to the normality of N, the left cosets and right cosets of N in G are the same, and so, G/N could have been defined to be the set of right cosets of N in G.\\n\\nExample: Addition modulo 6\\n\\nFor example, consider the group with addition modulo 6: G = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Consider the subgroup N = {0, 3}, which is normal because G is abelian. Then the set of (left) cosets is of size three:\\n\\n G/N = { a+N : a ∈ G } = { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5} } = { 0+N, 1+N, 2+N }.\\n\\nThe binary operation defined above makes this set into a group, known as the quotient group, which in this case is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3.\\n\\nMotivation for the name \"quotient\"\\nThe reason G/N is called a quotient group comes from division of integers.  When dividing 12 by 3 one obtains the answer 4 because one can regroup 12 objects into 4 subcollections of 3 objects.  The quotient group is the same idea, although we end up with a group for a final answer instead of a number because groups have more structure than an arbitrary collection of objects.\\n\\nTo elaborate, when looking at G/N with N a normal subgroup of G, the group structure is used to form a natural \"regrouping\".  These are the cosets of N in G.  Because we started with a group and normal subgroup, the final quotient contains more information than just the number of cosets (which is what regular division yields), but instead has a group structure itself.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nEven and odd integers\\nConsider the group of integers Z (under addition) and the subgroup 2Z consisting of all even integers. This is a normal subgroup, because Z is abelian. There are only two cosets: the set of even integers and the set of odd integers, and therefore the quotient group Z/2Z is the cyclic group with two elements. This quotient group is isomorphic with the set  with addition modulo\\xa02; informally, it is sometimes said that Z/2Z equals the set  with addition modulo 2.\\n\\nExample further explained...\\n\\n Let  remainders of  when dividing by .\\n Then  when  is even and  when  is odd.\\n By definition of ,  the kernel of ,\\n ker() ,  is the set of all even integers.\\n Let  ker().\\n Then  is a subgroup, because the identity in , which is , is in ,\\n the sum of two even integers is even and hence if  and  are in ,  is in  (closure)\\n and if  is even,  is also even and so  contains its inverses.\\n Define  as  for \\n and  is the quotient group of left cosets;  .\\n By the way we have defined ,    is  if  is odd and  if  is even.\\n Thus,  is an isomorphism from  to .\\n\\nRemainders of integer division\\nA slight generalization of the last example. Once again consider the group of integers Z under addition.  Let n be any positive integer. We will consider the subgroup nZ of Z consisting of all multiples of n. Once again nZ is normal in Z because Z is abelian. The cosets are the collection {nZ, 1+nZ, ..., (n−2)+nZ, (n−1)+nZ}. An integer k belongs to the coset r+nZ, where r is the remainder when dividing k by n. The quotient Z/nZ can be thought of as the group of \"remainders\" modulo n. This is a cyclic group of order n.\\n\\nComplex integer roots of 1\\n\\nThe twelfth roots of unity, which are points on the complex unit circle, form a multiplicative abelian group G, shown on the picture on the right as colored balls with the number at each point giving its complex argument. Consider its subgroup N made of the fourth roots of unity, shown as red balls. This normal subgroup splits the group into three cosets, shown in red, green and blue. One can check that the cosets form a group of three elements (the product of a red element with a blue element is blue, the inverse of a blue element is green, etc.). Thus, the quotient group G/N is the group of three colors, which turns out to be the cyclic group with three elements.\\n\\nThe real numbers modulo the integers\\nConsider the group of real numbers R under addition, and the subgroup Z of integers. Each coset of Z in R is a set of the form a+Z, where a is a real number. Since a1+Z and a2+Z are identical sets when the non-integer parts of a1 and a2 are equal, one may impose the restriction  without change of meaning. Adding such cosets is done by adding the corresponding real numbers, and subtracting 1 if the result is greater than or equal to 1. The quotient group R/Z is isomorphic to the circle group, the group of complex numbers of absolute value 1 under multiplication, or correspondingly, the group of rotations in 2D about the origin, that is, the special orthogonal group SO(2). An isomorphism is given by  (see Euler\\'s identity).\\n\\nMatrices of real numbers\\nIf G is the group of invertible 3 × 3 real matrices, and N is the subgroup of 3 × 3 real matrices with determinant 1, then N is normal in G (since it is the kernel of the determinant homomorphism). The cosets of N are the sets of matrices with a given determinant, and hence G/N is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers. The group N is known as the special linear group SL(3).\\n\\nInteger modular arithmetic\\nConsider the abelian group  (that is, the set  with addition modulo 4), and its subgroup . The quotient group  is .  This is a group with identity element , and group operations such as .  Both the subgroup  and the quotient group  are isomorphic with Z2.\\n\\nInteger multiplication\\nConsider the multiplicative group . The set N of nth residues is a multiplicative subgroup isomorphic to . Then N is normal in G and the factor group G/N has the cosets N, (1+n)N, (1+n)2N, ..., (1+n)n−1N. The Paillier cryptosystem is based on the conjecture that it is difficult to determine the coset of a random element of G without knowing the factorization of n.\\n\\nProperties\\nThe quotient group  is isomorphic to the trivial group (the group with one element), and  is isomorphic to G.\\n\\nThe order of , by definition the number of elements, is equal to , the index of N in G. If G is finite, the index is also equal to the order of G divided by the order of N. The set  may be finite, although both G and N are infinite (for example, ).\\n\\nThere is a \"natural\" surjective group homomorphism , sending each element g of G to the coset of N to which g belongs, that is: . The mapping π is sometimes called the canonical projection of G onto . Its kernel is N.\\n\\nThere is a bijective correspondence between the subgroups of G that contain N and the subgroups of ; if H is a subgroup of G containing N, then the corresponding subgroup of  is π(H). This correspondence holds for normal subgroups of G and  as well, and is formalized in the lattice theorem.\\n\\nSeveral important properties of quotient groups are recorded in the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms and the isomorphism theorems.\\n\\nIf G is abelian, nilpotent, solvable, cyclic or finitely generated, then so is .\\n\\nIf H is a subgroup in a finite group G, and the order of H is one half of the order of G, then H is guaranteed to be a normal subgroup, so  exists and is isomorphic to C2.  This result can also be stated as \"any subgroup of index 2 is normal\", and in this form it applies also to infinite groups. Furthermore, if p is the smallest prime number dividing the order of a finite group, G, then if  has order p, H must be a normal subgroup of G.\\n\\nGiven G and a normal subgroup N, then G is a group extension of  by N. One could ask whether this extension is trivial or split; in other words, one could ask whether G is a direct product or semidirect product of N and . This is a special case of the extension problem. An example where the extension is not split is as follows: Let G = Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and N = {0, 2}, which is isomorphic to Z2. Then  is also isomorphic to Z2. But Z2 has only the trivial automorphism, so the only semi-direct product of N and  is the direct product. Since Z4 is different from , we conclude that G is not a semi-direct product of N and .\\n\\nQuotients of Lie groups\\nIf  is a Lie group and  is a normal and closed (in the topological rather than the algebraic sense of the word) Lie subgroup of , the quotient  is also a Lie group.  In this case, the original group  has the structure of a fiber bundle (specifically, a principal -bundle), with base space  and fiber . The dimension of  equals .\\n\\nNote that the condition that  is closed is necessary. Indeed, if  is not closed then the quotient space is not a T1-space (since there is a coset in the quotient which cannot be separated from the identity by an open set), and thus not a Hausdorff space.\\n\\nFor a non-normal Lie subgroup , the space  of left cosets is not a group, but simply a differentiable manifold on which  acts.  The result is known as a homogeneous space.\\n\\nSee also\\nGroup extension\\nQuotient category\\nShort exact sequence\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n \\n \\n\\nGroup theory\\nGroup',\n",

       "       'In abstract algebra, a composition series provides a way to break up an algebraic structure, such as a group or a module, into simple pieces. The need for considering composition series in the context of modules arises from the fact that many naturally occurring modules are not semisimple, hence cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of simple modules. A composition series of a module M is a finite increasing filtration of M by submodules such that the successive quotients are simple and serves as a replacement of the direct sum decomposition of M into its simple constituents. \\n\\nA composition series may not exist, and when it does, it need not be unique. Nevertheless, a group of results known under the general name Jordan–Hölder theorem asserts that whenever composition series exist, the isomorphism classes of simple pieces (although, perhaps, not their location in the composition series in question) and their multiplicities are uniquely determined. Composition series may thus be used to define invariants of finite groups and Artinian modules.\\n\\nA related but distinct concept is a chief series: a composition series is a maximal subnormal series, while a chief series is a maximal normal series.\\n\\nFor groups\\nIf a group G has a normal subgroup N, then the factor group G/N may be formed, and some aspects of the study of the structure of G may be broken down by studying the \"smaller\" groups G/N and N. If G has no normal subgroup that is different from G and from the trivial group, then G is a simple group. Otherwise, the question naturally arises as to whether G can be reduced to simple \"pieces\", and if so, are there any unique features of the way this can be done? \\n\\nMore formally, a composition series of a group G is a subnormal series of finite length\\n\\nwith strict inclusions, such that each Hi is a maximal proper normal subgroup of Hi+1. Equivalently, a composition series is a subnormal series such that each factor group Hi+1 / Hi is simple. The factor groups are called composition factors.\\n\\nA subnormal series is a composition series if and only if it is of maximal length. That is, there are no additional subgroups which can be \"inserted\" into a composition series. The length n of the  series is called the composition length.\\n\\nIf a composition series exists for a group G, then any subnormal series of G can be refined to a composition series, informally, by inserting subgroups into the series up to maximality. Every finite group has a composition series, but not every infinite group has one. For example,  has no composition series.\\n\\nUniqueness: Jordan–Hölder theorem\\nA group may have more than one composition series. However, the Jordan–Hölder theorem (named after Camille Jordan and Otto Hölder) states that any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism. This theorem can be proved using the Schreier refinement theorem.  The Jordan–Hölder theorem is also true for transfinite ascending composition series, but not transfinite descending composition series . \\n gives a short proof of the Jordan–Hölder theorem by intersecting the terms in one subnormal series with those in the other series.\\n\\nExample\\nFor a cyclic group of order n, composition series correspond to ordered prime factorizations of n,  and in fact yields a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\\n\\nFor example, the cyclic group  has  and  as three different composition series. The sequences of composition factors obtained in the respective cases are  and\\n\\nFor modules\\n\\nThe definition of composition series for modules restricts all attention to submodules, ignoring all additive subgroups that are not submodules. Given a ring R and an R-module M, a composition series for M is a series of submodules \\n\\nwhere all inclusions are strict and Jk is a maximal submodule of Jk+1 for each k. As for groups,  if M has a composition series at all, then any finite strictly increasing series of submodules of M may be refined to a composition series, and any two composition series for M are equivalent. In that case, the (simple) quotient modules Jk+1/Jk are known as the composition factors of M, and the Jordan–Hölder theorem holds, ensuring that the number of occurrences of each isomorphism type of simple R-module as a composition factor does not depend on the choice of composition series. \\n\\nIt is well known that a module has a finite composition series if and only if it is both an Artinian module and a Noetherian module. If R is an Artinian ring, then every finitely generated R-module is Artinian and Noetherian, and thus has a finite composition series. In particular, for any field K, any finite-dimensional module for a finite-dimensional algebra over K has a composition series, unique up to equivalence.\\n\\nGeneralization\\nGroups with a set of operators generalize group actions and ring actions on a group. A unified approach to both groups and modules can be followed as in  or , simplifying some of the exposition. The group G is viewed as being acted upon by elements (operators) from a set Ω. Attention is restricted entirely to subgroups invariant under the action of elements from Ω, called Ω-subgroups. Thus Ω-composition series must use only Ω subgroups, and Ω-composition factors need only be Ω-simple. The standard results above, such as the Jordan–Hölder theorem, are established with nearly identical proofs.\\n\\nThe special cases recovered include when Ω = G so that G is acting on itself. An important example of this is when elements of G act by conjugation, so that the set of operators consists of the inner automorphisms. A composition series under this action is exactly a chief series. Module structures are a case of Ω-actions where Ω is a ring and some additional axioms are satisfied.\\n\\nFor objects in an abelian category\\nA composition series of an object A in an abelian category is a sequence of subobjects\\n\\nsuch that each quotient object Xi\\xa0/Xi\\xa0+\\xa01 is simple (for ).

The signalizer functor theorem gives conditions under which a signalizer functor comes from a subgroup.  The idea is to try to construct a -subgroup of a finite group , which has a good chance of being normal in , by taking as generators certain -subgroups of the centralizers of nonidentity elements in one or several given noncyclic elementary abelian -subgroups of  The technique has origins in the Feit–Thompson theorem, and was subsequently developed by many people including  who defined signalizer functors,  who proved the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem for solvable groups, and  who proved it for all groups.  This theorem is needed to prove the so-called \"dichotomy\" stating that a given nonabelian finite simple group either has local characteristic two, or is of component type. It thus plays a major role in the classification of finite simple groups.\\n\\nDefinition\\nLet A be a noncyclic elementary abelian p-subgroup of the finite group G. An A-signalizer functor on G or simply a signalizer functor when A and G are clear is a mapping θ from the set of nonidentity elements of A to the set of A-invariant p′-subgroups of G satisfying the following properties:\\nFor every nonidentity , the group  is contained in \\nFor every nonidentity , we have \\n\\nThe second condition above is called the balance condition. If the subgroups  are all solvable, then the signalizer functor  itself is said to be solvable.\\n\\nSolvable signalizer functor theorem\\nGiven  certain additional, relatively mild, assumptions allow one to prove that the subgroup  of  generated by the subgroups  is in fact a -subgroup. The Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem proved by Glauberman and mentioned above says that this will be the case if  is solvable and  has at least three generators. The theorem also states that under these assumptions,  itself will be solvable.\\n\\nSeveral earlier versions of the theorem were proven:  proved this under the stronger assumption that  had rank at least 5.  proved this under the assumption that  had rank at least 4 or was a 2-group of rank at least 3.  gave a simple proof for 2-groups using the ZJ theorem, and a proof in a similar spirit has been given for all primes by .  gave the definitive result for solvable signalizer functors.  Using the classification of finite simple groups,  showed that  is a -group without the assumption that  is solvable.\\n\\nCompleteness\\nThe terminology of completeness is often used in discussions of signalizer functors. Let  be a signalizer functor as above, and consider the set И of all -invariant -subgroups  of  satisfying the following condition:\\n for all nonidentity \\nFor example, the subgroups  belong to И by the balance condition. The signalizer functor  is said to be complete if И has a unique maximal element when ordered by containment. In this case, the unique maximal element can be shown to coincide with  above, and  is called the completion of . If  is complete, and  turns out to be solvable, then  is said to be solvably complete.\\n\\nThus, the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem can be rephrased by saying that if  has at least three generators, then every solvable -signalizer functor on  is solvably complete.\\n\\nExamples of signalizer functors\\nThe easiest way to obtain a signalizer functor is to start with an -invariant -subgroup  of  and define  for all nonidentity  In practice, however, one begins with  and uses it to construct the -invariant -group.\\n\\nThe simplest signalizer functor used in practice is this:\\n\\nA few words of caution are needed here. First, note that  as defined above is indeed an -invariant -subgroup of  because  is abelian. However, some additional assumptions are needed to show that this  satisfies the balance condition. One sufficient criterion is that for each nonidentity  the group  is solvable (or -solvable or even -constrained). Verifying the balance condition for this  under this assumption requires a famous lemma, known as Thompson\\'s -lemma. (Note, this lemma is also called Thompson\\'s -lemma, but the  in this use must not be confused with the  appearing in the definition of a signalizer functor!)\\n\\nCoprime action\\nTo obtain a better understanding of signalizer functors, it is essential to know the following general fact about finite groups:\\nLet  be an abelian noncyclic group acting on the finite group  Assume that the orders of  and  are relatively prime. Then\\n\\nTo prove this fact, one uses the Schur–Zassenhaus theorem to show that for each prime  dividing the order of  the group  has an -invariant Sylow -subgroup. This reduces to the case where  is a -group. Then an argument by induction on the order of  reduces the statement further to the case where  is elementary abelian with  acting  irreducibly. This forces the group  to be cyclic, and the result follows. See either of the books  or  for details.\\n\\nThis is used in both the proof and applications of the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem. To begin, notice that it quickly implies the claim that if  is complete, then its completion is the group  defined above.\\n\\nNormal completion\\nThe completion of a signalizer functor has a \"good chance\" of being normal in  according to the top of the article.

       "       'In mathematics, the rank, Prüfer rank, or torsion-free rank of an abelian group A is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. The rank of A determines the size of the largest free abelian group contained in A. If A is torsion-free then it embeds into a vector space over the rational numbers of dimension rank A. For finitely generated abelian groups, rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and torsion subgroup. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved.\\n\\nThe term rank has a different meaning in the context of elementary abelian groups.\\n\\nDefinition \\n\\nA subset {aα} of an abelian group A is linearly independent (over Z) if the only linear combination of these elements that is equal to zero is trivial: if\\n\\n \\n\\nwhere all but finitely many coefficients nα are zero (so that the sum is, in effect, finite), then all summands are 0. Any two maximal linearly independent sets in A have the same cardinality, which is called the rank of A.\\n\\nThe rank of an abelian group is analogous to the dimension of a vector space. The main difference with the case of vector space is a presence of torsion. An element of an abelian group A is classified as torsion if its order is finite. The set of all torsion elements is a subgroup, called the torsion subgroup and denoted T(A). A group is called torsion-free if it has no non-trivial torsion elements. The factor-group A/T(A) is the unique maximal torsion-free quotient of A and its rank coincides with the rank of A.\\n\\nThe notion of rank with analogous properties can be defined for modules over any integral domain, the case of abelian groups corresponding to modules over Z. For this, see finitely generated module#Generic rank.\\n\\nProperties \\n\\n The rank of an abelian group A coincides with the dimension of the Q-vector space A ⊗ Q. If A is torsion-free then the canonical map A → A ⊗ Q is injective and the rank of A is the minimum dimension of Q-vector space containing A as an abelian subgroup. In particular, any intermediate group Zn < A < Qn has rank n.\\n Abelian groups of rank 0 are exactly the periodic abelian groups.\\n The group Q of rational numbers has rank 1. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are realized as subgroups of Q and there is a satisfactory classification of them up to isomorphism. By contrast, there is no satisfactory classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 2.\\n Rank is additive over short exact sequences: if\\n\\nis a short exact sequence of abelian groups then rk B = rk A + rk C. This follows from the flatness of Q and the corresponding fact for vector spaces.\\n\\n Rank is additive over arbitrary direct sums:\\n\\n where the sum in the right hand side uses cardinal arithmetic.\\n\\nGroups of higher rank \\n\\nAbelian groups of rank greater than 1 are sources of interesting examples. For instance, for every cardinal d there exist torsion-free abelian groups of rank d that are indecomposable, i.e. cannot be expressed as a direct sum of a pair of their proper subgroups. These examples demonstrate that torsion-free abelian group of rank greater than 1 cannot be simply built by direct sums from torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1, whose theory is well understood. Moreover, for every integer , there is a torsion-free abelian group of rank  that is simultaneously a sum of two indecomposable groups, and a sum of n indecomposable groups. Hence even the number of indecomposable summands of a group of an even rank greater or equal than 4 is not well-defined.\\n\\nAnother result about non-uniqueness of direct sum decompositions is due to A.L.S. Corner: given integers , there exists a torsion-free abelian group A of rank n such that for any partition  into k natural summands, the group A is the direct sum of k indecomposable subgroups of ranks . Thus the sequence of ranks of indecomposable summands in a certain direct sum decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank is very far from being an invariant of A.\\n\\nOther surprising examples include torsion-free rank 2 groups An,m and Bn,m such that An is isomorphic to Bn if and only if n is divisible by m.\\n\\nFor abelian groups of infinite rank, there is an example of a group K and a subgroup G such that \\n K is indecomposable; \\n K is generated by G and a single other element; and \\n Every nonzero direct summand of G is decomposable.\\n\\nGeneralization\\nThe notion of rank can be generalized for any module M over an integral domain R, as the dimension over R0, the quotient field, of the tensor product of the module with the field:\\n\\nIt makes sense, since R0 is a field, and thus any module (or, to be more specific, vector space) over it is free.\\n\\nIt is a generalization, since any abelian group is a module over the integers.

       "array([\"Paenibacillus dendritiformis is a species of pattern-forming bacteria, first discovered in the early 90s by Eshel Ben-Jacob's group. It is a social microorganism that forms colonies with complex and dynamic architectures. The genus Paenibacillus comprises facultative anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria originally included within the genus Bacillus and then reclassified as a separate genus in 1993. Bacteria belonging to this genus have been detected in a variety of environments such as: soil, water, rhizosphere, vegetable matter, forage and insect larvae.\\n\\nPaenibacillus spp. \\n\\nIn recent years there is an increasing interest in studies of Paenibacillus spp. since many were found to be important for industrial, agricultural and medical applications. These bacteria produce various extracellular enzymes such as polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and proteases, which can catalyze a wide variety of synthetic reactions in fields ranging from cosmetics to biofuel production. Various Paenibacillus spp. also produce antimicrobial substances that affect a wide spectrum of micro-organisms such as fungi, soil bacteria, plant pathogenic bacteria and even important anaerobic pathogens as Clostridium botulinium.\\n\\nPattern formation, self-organization and social behaviors\\n\\nP. dendritiformis is a social microorganism: when grown under growth conditions that mimic natural environments such as hard surfaces, it forms colonies of 109-1012 cells with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures (Figure 1). Being part of a large cooperative, the bacteria can better compete for food resources and be protected against antibacterial assaults.\\nThe P. dendritiformis exhibit many distinct physiological and genetic traits including β-galactosidase-like activity causing colonies to turn blue on X-gal plates and multiple drug resistance (MDR) (including septrin, penicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, streptomycin and mitomycin C. Colonies that are grown on surfaces in Petri dishes exhibit several folds higher drug resistance in comparison to growth in liquid media. This particular resistance is believed to be due to a surfactant-like liquid front that actually forms a particular pattern on the Petri plate.\\n\\nSimilar to other social bacteria Paenibacillus species, P. dendritiformis can form complex patterns on semi-solid surfaces. Development of such complex colonies require self-organization and cooperative behavior of individual cells while employing sophisticated chemical communication.  Pattern formation and self-organization in microbial systems is an intriguing phenomenon, reflection social behaviors of bacteria that might provide insights into the evolutionary development of the collective action of cells in higher organisms.\\n\\nP. dendritiformis colonies behave much like a multi-cellular organism, with cell differentiation and task distribution. Accomplishing such intricate cooperative ventures requires sophisticated cell-cell communication including semantic and pragmatic aspects of linguistics.\\n\\nCommunicating with each other using a variety of chemical signals, bacteria exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic and epigenetic adjustments. The bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed information processing to glean and assess relevant information. The information is then used by the bacteria for reshaping the colony while redistributing tasks and cell epigenetic differentiations, for collective decision-making and for turning on and off defense and offense mechanisms needed to thrive in competitive environments, faculties that can be perceived as social intelligence of bacteria.\\n\\nMorphotype transition\\n\\nThe P. dendritiformis, poses an intriguing collective faculty – the ability to switch between different morphotypes to better adapt in complex environments. Mostly studied is the transition between the Branching (or tip-splitting) morphotype (Figure 1) and the Chiral morphotype (Figure 2) that is marked by curly branches with well defined handedness.\\n\\nThe morphotype transition (Figure 3), can be viewed as an identity switching – the calls can cooperatively make drastic alterations of their internal genomic state, effectively transforming themselves into differently looking and behaving cells which can generate colonies with entirely different organization. Under conditions somewhat more favorable to motion, such as growth on a softer substrate, the bacteria engineer classes of chiral colony patterns in which the branches are thinner and curl in the same direction (Figure 2). Accompanying the colonial structure is a designed genome change: the bacteria are now programmed to become longer and have multiple chromosomes. The morphotype transition are both inheritable - the identity is maintained during LB growth and even through sporulation/germination, and reversible – for example the reverse transitions from chiral to ordinary branching occur on harder substrates (when higher bacteria densities are required to produce sufficient amounts of lubrication). Optical microscope observations during colony development reveal the following: upon elongation, the cells alter their collective movement from the typical run-and-tumble to a coordinated forward-backward movement with limited tumbling.\\n\\nGenome sequence\\n\\nThe genome sequence of the P. dendritiformis can be downloaded on the NCBI website here, or genetic information can be received upon request from the Tauber Sequencing Initiative at Tel-Aviv University, Israel. The genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using 454 Life Sciences and Illumina, achieving a total of 340X coverage, with 99.8% sequence identity between the two methods. Preliminary analysis of the P. dendritiformis genome (approximate size of 6.6Mbp) revealed 6,782 open reading frames (ORFs). The analysis also unveiled the P. dendritiformis potential to produces a wealth of enzymes and proteases as well as a great variety of antimicrobial substances that affect a wide range of microorganisms. The possession of these advanced defense and offense strategies render P. dendritiformis as a rich source of useful genes for agricultural, medical, industrial and biofuel applications.\\n\\nCompetition between sibling bacterial colonies\\n\\nIn 2000 it was discovered, that two sibling colonies (colonies taken from the same mother colony or from the same LB growth) of the P. dendritiformis inoculated side by side can inhibit the growth of one another (Figure 4). Recent detailed studies of the phenomenon in the branching morphotype, revealed that the two colonies not only inhibit each other from growing into the territory between them but induced the death of those cells close to the border. Material extracted from the agar gel between two colonies was found to kill single growing colonies. By employing molecular biology methods combined with the new genome sequencing information and bioinformatics, they discovered a new toxin (sibling lethal factor), which acts selectively only on the same bacterial strain. The findings suggest a new strategy for fighting bacteria by self-toxins they produce.\\n\\nSee also\\n Paenibacillus vortex\\n Genus Paenibacillus\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Prof. Eshel Ben-Jacob's home page\\n Realizing Social Intelligence of Bacteria\\n Bacterial art\\n Bacterial self–organization: co–enhancement of complexification and adaptability in a dynamic environment\\n Bacterial linguistic communication and social intelligence\\n The genius of bacteria\\n Gambling on Bacteria\\n The tree of Life: IQ Test for Bacteria\\nType strain of Paenibacillus dendritiformis at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\\n\\nPaenibacillaceae\\nBacteria described in 1994\",\n",
       "       'Parasutterella is a genus of Gram-negative, circular/rod-shaped, obligate anaerobic, non-spore forming bacteria from the Proteobacteria phylum, Betaproteobacteria class and the family Sutterellaceae. Previously, this genus was considered \"unculturable,\" meaning that it could not be characterized through conventional laboratory techniques, such as grow in culture due its unique requirements of anaerobic environment. The genus was initially discovered through 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis (a methodology to analyze the microbiome). By analyzing the sequence similarity, Parasutterella was determined to be related most closely to the genus Sutterella and previously classified in the family Alcaligenaceae.\\n\\nIn 2009, Parasutterella excrementihominis was cultured and characterized. In 2011, another species of Parasutterella, Parasutterella secunda, was discovered, and both Parasutterella and Sutterella species were reclassified under the family Sutterellaceae. (This reclassification occurred due to the similar biochemical potential in the Sutterella and Parasutterella genera different from other genera in the family Alcaligenaceae.) To date, Parasutterella contains two cultured species and numerous uncultured species. Both cultured species were isolated from human feces and are considered to be part of the gut microbiome in a healthy individual.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nParasutterella species are Gram-negative, coccobacilli (circular and rod-shaped), strictly (or obligate) anaerobic, non-motile bacteria. When cultured, colonies from both P. excrementihominis and P. secunda appeared translucent to beige in color, convex and circular in shape, and extremely small in size. Both species do not metabolize glucose, lactate, or succinate or produce indole or short-chain fatty acids. Additionally, these bacteria do not reduce nitrate and are catalase-negative (inability to breakdown hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water), urease-negative (inability to hydrolyze urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide), and oxidase-negative (inability to use oxygen). However, these bacteria have the following enzymes: arginine dihydrolase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, and alkaline phosphatase. P. excrementihominis can grow in bile, although P. secunda has not been described in terms of this ability. Moreover, P. excrementihominis and P. secunda are unique in terms of sequences and certain biochemical processes. For example, the major respiratory quinone of P. excrementihominis was methylmenaquinone-6 whereas the dominant respiratory quinone for P. secunda is methylmenaquinone-5.\\n\\nParasutterella and Sutterella contain several similarities, including sequence homology, inability to grow in an aerobic environment, oxidase- and catalase-negative, and the dominant major quinone of either methylmenaquinone-5 or -6 or menaquinone-5 or -6. Still, Parasutterella species can be differentiated from Sutterella species in several ways. For example, colonies from Sutterella tend to appear a little larger and under the microscope, appear as bacilli or rod-shaped bacteria. While both species of Parasutterella do not reduce nitrate, some species from Sutterella have the ability for nitrate reduction. Both P. excrementihominis and P. secunda have the enzyme esterase, whereas no species in Sutterella to date have esterase (C4). Also, the major cellular fatty acids in Parasutterella are different than those associated with Sutterella.\\n\\nMolecular taxonomy\\nParasutterella has been divided into three different groups on the basis of their 16S rRNA sequences: P. excrementihominis, P. secunda, and uncultured bacterium. In the Silva 16S rRNA reference library, each group can then be further divided into various accession numbers or operational taxonomical units (OTUs) due to slight differences in sequence. P. excrementihominis has six different OTUs or strains, whereas P. secunda has three different OTUs.\\n\\nAssociations in human health\\nParasutterella is still a relatively new genus and has been exclusively published in regards to literature on the intestinal microbiome (with the exception of the first two taxonomical papers on the discovery of P. excrementihominis and P. secunda). Both P. excrementihominis and P. secunda were isolated from fecal samples from healthy Japanese individuals and have been found to be part of the intestinal microbiome in the United States. In a study that examined the effect of introducing and reversing diet-induced obesity on the gut microbiome and metabolism in mice, Parasutterella was decreased in mice with diet-induced obesity and increased in controls and reversal of the high fat diet with a healthier alternative (normal chow). Other studies have shown increases of Parasutterella with sugar and alcohol consumption. Additional microbiome studies have associated increased abundance of Parasutterella with dysbiosis, or a lack of diversity in the microbial composition typically in the gut. (Dysbiosis has been correlated with intestinal and metabolic dysfunction and several diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases and obesity.) For example, Parasutterella was increased in the submucosa in the ileum of the small intestine in individuals with Crohn\\'s disease and hypertriglyceridemia-related acute necrotizing pancreatitis in rats. More research is needed to further explore the role of Parasutterella species as a part of the healthy gut microbiome and in microbial dysbiosis.\\n\\nSee also\\n Proteobacteria\\n Betaproteobacteria\\n Sutterellaceae\\n Parasutterella excrementihominis\\n Parasutterella secunda\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBurkholderiales\\nBacteria genera',\n",
       "       \"Paenibacillus vortex is a species of pattern-forming bacteria, first discovered in the early 1990s by Eshel Ben-Jacob's group at Tel Aviv University. It is a social microorganism that forms colonies with complex and dynamic architectures. P. vortex is mainly found in heterogeneous and complex environments, such as the rhizosphere, the soil region directly influenced by plant roots.\\n\\nThe genus Paenibacillus comprises facultative anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria originally included within the genus Bacillus and then reclassified as a separate genus in 1993. Bacteria in the genus have been detected in a variety of environments such as: soil, water, vegetable matter, forage and insect larvae, as well as clinical samples. Paenibacillus spp., including P. vortex, produce extracellular enzymes that catalyze a variety of synthetic reactions in industrial, agricultural and medical applications. Various Paenibacillus spp. also produce antimicrobial substances that can affect micro-organisms such as fungi, in addition to soil and plant pathogenic bacteria.\\n\\nSocial Motility \\n\\nPaenibacillus vortex possesses advanced social motility employing cell-cell attractive and repulsive chemotactic signalling and physical links. When grown on soft surfaces (e.g. agar), the collective motility is reflected by the formation of foraging swarms that act as arms sent out in search of food. These swarms have an aversion to crossing each other’s trail and collectively change direction when food is sensed. The “swarming intelligence” P. vortex, is further marked by the fact that of the swarms can even split and reunite when detecting scattered patches of nutrients.\\n\\nPattern Formation and Social Behaviors \\n\\nP. vortex is a social microorganism: when grown on under growth conditions that mimic natural environments such as hard surfaces it forms colonies of 109-1012 cells with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures (Figure 1). Being part of a large cooperative, the bacteria can better compete for food resources and be protected against antibacterial assaults. Under laboratory growth conditions, similar to other social bacteria, P. vortex colonies behave much like a multi-cellular organism, with cell differentiation and task distribution. P. vortex is marked by its ability to generate special aggregates of dense bacteria that are pushed forward by repulsive chemotactic signals sent from the cells at the back. These rotating aggregates termed vortices (Figure 2), pave the way for the colony to expand. The vortices serve as building blocks of colonies with special modular organization (Figure 1). Accomplishing such intricate cooperative ventures requires sophisticated cell-cell communication, including semantic and pragmatic aspects of linguistics. Communicating with each other using a variety of chemical signals, bacteria exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic and epigenetic adjustments. The bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed information processing to glean and assess relevant information. The information is then used by the bacteria for reshaping the colony while redistributing tasks and cell epigenetic differentiations, for collective decision-making and for turning on and off defense and offense mechanisms needed to thrive in competitive environments, faculties that can be perceived as social intelligence of bacteria.\\n\\nGenome Sequence of the Paenibacillus vortex \\n\\nThe genome sequence of the P. vortex  is now available [GenBank: ADHJ00000000). The genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using 454 Life Sciences and Illumina, achieving a total of 289X coverage, with 99.8% sequence identity between the two methods. The sequencing results were validated using a custom designed Agilent microarray expression chip submitted to EMBL-EBI [ArrayExpress: E-MEXP-3019 which represented the coding and the non-coding regions. Analysis of the P. vortex genome revealed 6,437 open reading frames (ORFs) and 73 non-coding RNA genes. The analysis also unveiled the P. vortex potential to produce a wealth of enzymes and proteases as well as a great variety of antimicrobial substances that affect a wide range of microorganisms. The possession of these advanced defense and offense strategies render Paenibacillus vortex as a rich source of useful genes for agricultural, medical, industrial and biofuel applications.\\n\\nComparative Genomics and Social-IQ Score \\n\\nComparative genomic analysis revealed that bacteria successful in heterogeneous and competitive environments often contain extensive signal transduction and regulatory networks. Detailed comparative genomic analysis with a dataset of 500 complete bacterial genomes revealed that P. vortex has the third highest number of signal transduction genes, slightly below two other Paenibacillus species, Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and Paenibacillus sp. Y412MC10. The comparative genomic analysis further revealed that these three Paenibacillus species also have the highest “Social-IQ” score among all 500 sequenced bacteria, over 3 standard deviations higher than average. The score is based on the number of genes which afford bacteria abilities to communicate and process environmental information (two-component and transcription-factor genes), to make decisions and to synthesize offensive (toxic) and defensive (neutralizing) agents as needed during chemical warfare with other microorganisms. Defined this way, the Social-IQ score provides a measure of the genome capacity for social intelligence, hence it helps realizing social intelligence of bacteria.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n Genome sequence of the pattern forming Paenibacillus vortex bacterium reveals potential for thriving in complex environments.\\n Prof. Eshel Ben-Jacob's Home Page\\n Realizing Social Intelligence of Bacteria\\n Bacterial Art\\n\\nPaenibacillaceae\\nBacteria described in 1994\",\n",
       "       'Clostridium tertium is an anaerobic, motile, gram-positive bacterium. Although it can be considered an uncommon pathogen in humans, there has been substantial evidence of septic episodes in human beings. C. tertium is easily decolorized in Gram-stained smears and can be mistaken for a Gram-negative organism. However, C. tertium does not grow on selective media for Gram-negative organisms.\\n\\nHistory\\nClostridium tertium was initially isolated from war wounds by Captain Herbert Henry (RAMC) in 1917, but it was not until the first human cases of C. tertium bacteremia were reported in 1963 that it was recognized as a human pathogen.  C. tertium has been isolated in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients, and in cases of necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene. It has also been recognized as a causative agent of enteritis in cattle, but it is an uncommon human pathogen. C. tertium has also been isolated from soil and from faeces of healthy neonates and infants.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nClostridium tertium is a Gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacillus found in the soil and the gut of many animal species, including humans.  C. tertium distinguishes itself from other clostridia as a non-toxin producing, aerotolerant, non-histotoxic and non-lipolytic species.  Aerotolerant strains of anaerobic bacteria can tolerate oxygen and exhibit growth to some extent in the presence of oxygen.  The aerotolerance of C. tertium can lead to its misidentification as Bacillus spp. or Lactobacillus spp.  A negative catalase test is an easy tool to differentiate C. tertium from Bacillus spp., which are catalase positive. Also, C. tertium only forms spores anaerobically, as opposed to Bacillus spp., which sporulates aerobically.  Other distinct characteristics are its large size (1.5 x 10 micrometers) and its unusual \"square\" morphology on Gram stained smear.\\n\\nVirulence\\n\\nClostridium tertium has traditionally been considered nonpathogenic, but increasingly it is being reported as a human pathogen.  The organism has been associated with bacteremia, meningitis, septic arthritis, enterocolitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, post-traumatic brain abscess, and pneumonia.  It has also been increasingly recognized as an important cause of sepsis in immunocompromised patients.  C. tertium has also been implicated with osteomyelitis, and miscellaneous soft tissue infections in humans.\\n\\nClostridium tertium does not appear to secrete any toxin; instead, it damages gastrointestinal mucosa by direct colonization.  Three major factors have been associated with C. tertium bacteremia: intestinal mucosal injury, neutropenia, and history of exposure to β-lactam antibiotics (particularly third generation cephalosporins). Almost all reported cases of C. tertium bacteremia have been in neutropenic patients without any obvious source of infection.\\n\\nIt has been established that C. tertium elaborates enzymes directed against blood group A antigen in the presence of glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, intact blood group substance with suboptimal glucose, or completely hydrolyzed blood group substance.<ref name=\"Howe_1957\">Howe C., MacLennan JD, Mandl I, Kabat EA, (1957). \"Enzymes of Clostridium tertium.\" Department of Microbiology and Neurology\" Columbia University.</ref>  The blood group A-splitting activity of C. tertium enzymes was inhibited by copper, zinc and nickel ions.\\n\\nTreatmentClostridium tertium bacteremia can cause fever, and directed antibiotic therapy is indicated.  C. tertium is commonly (but not universally) resistant to many β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin; clindamycin; and metronidazole; but it is susceptible to vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Mortality related to C. tertium bacteremia treated appropriately appears to be quite low. The selection effect of antibiotics on C. tertium\\'\\' may occur in cases where patients have had prior exposure to β-lactam antibiotics.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nType strain of Clostridium tertium at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\\n\\nGram-positive bacteria\\nBacteria described in 1923\\ntertium',\n",
       "       'Neisseria bacilliformis  is a bacterium commonly found living as a commensal in the mucous membranes of mammals. However, depending on host immunocompetence, there have been documented cases of N. bacilliformis infections of the respiratory tract and oral cavity thus making it an opportunistic pathogen. It was originally isolated from patients being treated in a cancer center. Rarely, a more serious infection such as endocarditis can occur often as a result of a predisposing condition. \\n\\n\\nMorphology\\nWith the exceptions of N. elongata and N. weaveri, most members of the genus Neisseria have a cocci or diplococci cellular morphology. However, N. bacilliformis has a bacillus morphology measuring 0.6\\xa0µm by 1.3\\xa0µm to 3.0\\xa0µm. N. bacilliformis is nonmotile and it undergoes aerobic respiration. It stains Gram negative and has been successfully cultured on chocolate agar and sheep blood agar.  No hemolysis has been observed. Growth has been documented on trypticase soy agar, but the size of the colonies are roughly half that of those cultured on chocolate agar and sheep blood agar. Growth has not been achieved on modified Thayer–Martin culture agar, the preferred media for culturing N. gonorrhoeae. Colonies are round, smooth, and have a light gray coloration. It tests positive for the oxidase test and negative for indole production. No acid is produced in the presence of dextrose, lactose, maltose, or sucrose. Some strains are capable of reducing nitrate and producing catalase. All strains that have been isolated thus far have shown susceptibility to antibiotics.\\n\\nClinical differentiation\\nClinical microbiology laboratories often misidentify N. bacilliformis as a member of the genus Pasteurella or Moraxella. They too are commensals of the respiratory tract, and encountering a Neisseria spp. with a bacillus morphology is unusual. Similar morphological and biochemical identifiers of N. elongata further compound such misidentifications. Thus it is possible that some cases that were identified as N. elongata infections using phenotypic assays may have been caused by N. bacilliformis. 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis has been used to identify a member of Neisseria from closely related genera, but this method is unable to distinguish amongst the various species that compose the genus Neisseria. Whole-genome sequence data is currently the most reliable method to diagnose a N. bacilliformis infection. A proper identification is crucial in order to design the most effective antibiotic therapy.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nType strain of Neisseria bacilliformis at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\\n\\nNeisseriales\\nBacteria described in 2006',\n",

The type species for this genus is Fredinandcohnia humi.\\n\\nFredinandcohnia comprises species originally belonging to the genus Bacillus, whose polyphyletic nature has long been recognized as an issue by the scientific community. The vague nature of the criteria used to assign species into Bacillus resulted in a large genus full of unrelated organisms with a diverse range of biochemical characteristics. Multiple phylogenetic studies have been conducted to clarify the taxonomy of this genus, resulting in the transfer of many species into novel genera such as Virgibacillus, Solibacillus, Brevibacillus and Ectobacillus. Recently, Bacillus has been restricted only include species closely related to Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus.\\n\\nThe name Fredinandcohnia was chosen to celebrate the German biologist Professor Ferdinand Cohn (1828-1898), a founder of modern bacteriology and microbiology.\\n\\nBiochemical Characteristics and Molecular Signatures \\nMembers of the genus Fredinandcohnia are mainly aerobic, but some species are facultatively anaerobic. Cells are all motile and endospore-forming. Most members are salt-tolerant and are able to grow in environments containing 0-5% (w/v) NaCl. Species can be found in a variety of environments, such as soil, rice fields, human stool, air in caves and hypersaline lakes. Fredinandcohnia can survive in temperatures ranging from 5°C to 47°C, but optimal growth occurs in the range of 30-37°C.  \\n\\nAnalysis of genome sequences have identified eight conserved signature indels (CSIs) which are specific for the members of this genus. These conserved indels are present in the following proteins: triose-phosphate isomerase, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, bis(5\\'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase PrpE, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit, GNAT family N-acetyltransferase, LTA synthase family protein, DNA-binding protein WhiA and nucleoside triphosphatase YtkD, and they provide reliable means to molecularly differentiate Fredinandcohnia from other Bacillaceae genera and bacteria.\\n\\nTaxonomy \\nAs of May 2021, there are a total of 4 species with validly published names in the genus Ferdinandcohnia.  These members are found to group together on various phylogenetic trees created based on concatenated sequences from various datasets of conserved proteins and 16S rRNA genome sequences in a monophyletic branch.

       "       'Suttonella indologenes, formerly Kingella indologenes, is a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium of the family Cardiobacteriaceae. Like other members of its family, it is a bacterium that is assumed to be normally present in the respiratory tract. It has been found to rarely cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. It also been found in the eye. It may cause eye infections. Little is known about it as a bacterium other than its structure and biochemical composition. Like other members in its family, it has a characteristic 16S ribosomal RNA which consists of 1474 base pairs.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nIn 1976 the species Moraxella kingae was elevated to become its own genus Kingella. Snell and Lapage, introduced two new novel species to the new genus. Kingella indologenes and K. denitrificans. In 1990 Dewhirst et al. moved Kingella indologenes (Snell and Lapage, 1976) to the new genus Suttonella renaming the species Suttonella indologenes at the same time they transferred Bacteroides nodosus (Beveridge 1941) to the new genus Dichelobacter forming the new species name Dichelobacter nodosus. With these changes they reassigned the genera Cardiobacterium, Dichelobacter, and Suttonella to the new family of Cardiobacteriaceae. See below for the phylogeny of the family. The new family of Cardiobacteriaceae is identified through its rod-shape and being Gram-negative. It also has pili, but no flagella. Cardiobacterium hominis also causes endocarditis. Cardiobacterium hominis is part of the HACEK group of bacteria that cause infective endocarditis. S. indologenes is not part of the HAECK group of organisms but has very similar characteristics. After Dewhirst et al., there have not been any major significant breakthroughs in the research into the species S. indologenes. Although there have been discoveries of the species as an endocarditic agent. Additionally the first known case of echocardiographically documented prosthetic endocarditis caused by S. indologenes was presented in 2005.\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nSuttonella indologenes are Gram negative, but they can resists Gram decolorization. They are non-motile, but they have type 4 pili (fimbriae), which exhibits twitching motility. They are aerobic, and their aerobic growth is enhanced by high humidity and CO2, disguising the organisms to be facultatively anaerobic. They are straight rods that are 1.0 pm in diameter and 2 to 3 micrometers long and have rounded ends.\\n\\nThe colony morphology of S. indologenes has a characteristic \"halo\" or fried egg appearance due to its twitching motility. Pinprick colonies with a 1-2mm halo may be obtained after 24 hours of microaerobic growth at 37\\xa0°C on blood agar, at least doubling in size after 48 hours.\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nThe pathophysiology of Suttonella indologenes is relatively unknown. However it has been shown to be able to cause endocarditis. It most likely follows a similar path with other infective endocarditis causing agents.\\n\\nHosts\\n\\nThe only known host for Suttonella indologenes is humans, however a new species, Suttonella ornithocola has been discovered to cause endocarditis in birds. This makes Suttonella ornithocola the second known species in the genus Suttonella.\\n\\nLife cycle\\n\\nThe life cycle of Suttonella indologenes is relatively unknown. Like other members of its family, it is a bacterium that is assumed to be normally present in the respiratory tract. However, it has also been found in the eye.\\n\\nEffects on Fitness\\nSuttonella indologenes has been shown to cause endocarditis and eye infections. See epidemiology.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nThe epidemiology (morbidity and mortality rates) of Suttonella indologenes is unknown when it causes endocarditis. There is no current method to isolate Suttonella indologenes. It is unknown if the pathogen itself can be infected.\\n\\nHowever, in general, the incidence of infective endocarditis in a general population has been estimated at between 2 and 6 cases per 100,000. Additionally, in the incidence rate of endocarditis is likely to increase in people who have current or genetic predisposition to heart problems. Mortality for infective endocarditis is around 20%. Prior to antibiotics survival was not likely.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nThe Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria can be identified through blood cultures from the heart of patient\\'s displaying endocarditis. It has many characteristics that help distinguish it. Please see the image on the below. It can be differentiated from C. hominis because C. hominis is positive for trypsin, phosphohydrolase, sorbitol, and mannitol acidification, whereas S. indologenes is positive for alkaline phosphatase and Tween 20 and Tween 40 hydrolysis.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nAlthough there is no understanding of the mechanisms by which this specific pathogen operates, it can be safely assumed that extremely hygienic environments are needed when operating on the heart, so that a resulting infective endocarditis does not occur. The endocarditis is clearly a result in a build-up of the pathogen in the heart, most likely vegetating in a thrombus formation. Obviously, living a heart healthy life style is crucial in preventing any major heart complications.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nSuttonella indologenes is susceptible to ampicillin and ceftriaxone, with proper dosage it can be treated through the antibiotics. Surgery may be required for some.\\n\\nHuman relevance\\n\\nThe financial impact of this pathogen is unknown. Since the incidence rate is so low, it may not be prioritized but infective endocarditis deserves more attention. Especially, since the exact rate for infective endocarditis is unknown. See epidemiology.\\n\\nThere is some interest in the twitching motility that is most likely caused by its type 4 fimbriae which is somewhat characteristic of its family.\\n\\nSee also\\nEndocarditis\\nCardiobacteriaceae\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nType strain of Suttonella indologenes at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\\n\\nGammaproteobacteria',\n",

They are virtually ubiquitous and do not cause problems for most people, but propionibacteria have been implicated in acne and other skin conditions.  One study found the Propionibacterium was the most prevalent human skin-associated genus of microorganisms.\\n\\nMembers of the genus Propionibacterium are widely used in the production of vitamin B12, tetrapyrrole compounds, and propionic acid, as well as in the probiotics and cheese industries.\\n\\nThe strain Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii is used in cheesemaking to create CO2 bubbles that become \"eyes\"—round holes in the cheese.\\n\\nPathology \\nPropionibacterium spp. are commensal bacteria that can occasionally cause infectious diseases. The most studied of these infections is acne vulgaris, caused by Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes). It is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the blockage of pilosebaceous units causing inflammatory lesions, non-inflammatory lesions or a mixture of both on the face, neck and/or chest. Acne vulgaris cannot be defined as an infectious disease since the bacteria is found on a vast majority of individuals without causing lesions. C. acnes colonize the skin only under certain favorable conditions. In most cases, C. acnes get trapped under the comedones where they proliferate to form micro-comedones, not visible to the naked eye, which can later form structures such as closed comedones (white heads) and open comedones. These comedones can rupture, releasing the follicular material inside the dermis. The cause of this rupture was thought to be the indirect effect of fat metabolism by the bacteria, however it was later found that bacteria are directly involved in comedome rupturing by producing factors such as proteases, hyaluronidases and neuraminidases which might be involved in thinning of the epithelium. C. acnes can also produce immune factors such as proinflammatory cytokine inducing-factors and chemotactic factors, and can induce host complement pathways.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nPropionibacterineae\\nBacteria genera',\n",
       "       'Limosilactobacillus fermentum is a Gram-positive species in the heterofermentative genus Limosilactobacillus. It is associated with active dental caries lesions. It is also commonly found in fermenting animal and plant material including sourdough and cocoa fermentation. A few strains are considered probiotic or \"friendly\" bacteria in animals  and at least one strain has been applied to treat urogenital infections in women.  Some strains of lactobacilli formerly mistakenly classified as L. fermentum (such as RC-14) have since been reclassified as Limosilactobacillus reuteri. Commercialized strains of L. fermentum used as probiotics include PCC, ME-3 and CECT5716\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum belongs to the genus Limosilactobacillus. Species in this genus are heterofermentative and adapted to the intestinal tract of vertebrates but also used for a wide variety of applications including food and feed fermentation. L. fermentum differs from most or all other species in the genus as it has a nomadic lifestyle and is not a stable member of human or animal intestinal microbiota. It has been found that some strains for L. fermentum have natural resistances to certain antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. They are considered potential vectors of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment to humans or animals to humans.\\n\\nSome strains of L. fermentum have been associated with cholesterol metabolism.\\n\\nProbiotic\\nA microorganism is considered a probiotic by meeting certain characteristics, such as being of human origin, non-pathogenic, having high resistance to passing through the intestine, and being beneficial to the immune system. In general, they are seen as beneficial to the host\\'s body and the human health. L. fermentum has been identified as potential probiotic.\\nThe use of gut microbes as probiotics in food is aimed towards preventing and treating various health problems. Among these health problems allergies, neoplastic growth, and inflammatory bowel disease are included. Recent areas of study have focused on the influence of probiotics on metabolic functions of their host. One area has been the metabolism of cholesterol by LABs acting as probiotics. Research has shown that lactobacilli have been proven to remove cholesterol in vitro through various ways such as assimilation, binding to the surface cells, and incorporation into cellular membranes.\\n\\npH and bile tolerance\\nTesting of L. fermentum  against different pH concentration solutions revealed that it has a strong pH tolerance by its ability to grow and survive a few hours after being incubated in a 3-pH level solution. Strains of L. fermentum have also been tested in different bile concentrations and demonstrated to have good bile tolerance when incubated with 3 g L-1 of bile salt. L. fermentum has been found to survive in these conditions further supporting the idea that it can act as a probiotic.\\n\\nCholesterol reduction\\nOne of the ways in which L. fermentum has been seen as a probiotic is by its ability to reduce cholesterol levels. Tests conducted using several  lactobacilli and cholesterol broths demonstrated that L. fermentum had the largest removal of cholesterol. One of the mechanisms by which  L. fermentum may remove cholesterol through in vivo is by the absorption of cholesterol, which as a result accelerates cholesterol metabolism. Another method is by the incorporation of cholesterol in the host body into its cell membrane or walls. This would also increase resistance of the bacterial cell membranes to environmental challenge. A third mechanism is by causing the body to consume more cholesterol. L. fermentum  would interfere with the recycling of bile salt and facilitate its elimination, which as a result would increase the demand for bile salt made from cholesterol.\\n\\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum ME-3\\nThe strain L. fermentum ME-3 has recently been discovered and identified as an antimicrobial and antioxidative probiotic. This strain of L. fermentum was discovered from the analysis of human fecal samples in 1994. One of the important characteristics of a probiotic microbe is the tolerance to conditions in the digestive tract. Tests conducted on the ME-3 strain in different bile concentrations found that it was able to survive without large loss in numbers. It has also been found that  L. fermentum ME-3 has a tolerance to survive drops of pH levels. It  can withstand a drop in values from 4.0 to 2.5 without decreasing in numbers. These characteristics of tolerance to bile concentrations and pH levels serve to classify ME-3 as a probiotic.\\n\\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum ME-3 has also been found to have the capability to suppress mainly gram-negative bacteria. To a lesser extent, ME-3 has also been observed to be able to suppress enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. This would serve a beneficial purpose to the host. ME-3 has several antimicrobial characteristics. These include acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Research on the antioxidant properties of strain ME-3 in soft cheese products revealed that it prevented spoilage.\\nExperimentation has also been conducted on the consumption of the ME-3 strain. The consumption had a positive influence on the microbiota of the gut. Volunteers were given goat milk fermented by strain ME-3 and capsulated ME-3. After three weeks analysis of fecal samples revealed that the ME-3 strain increased the number of beneficial Lactobacilli  in comparison to those who were given non-fermented milk.\\nSeveral human clinical studies performed on ME-3 focused on parameters related to cardiovascular disease development. Consumption of ME-3 indeed results in a reduction of oxidized LDL cholesterol, which is a major contributor to atherosclerosis development. Several mechanisms may contribute to the antioxidant effect of ME-3: the strain modulates the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione in the blood, and increases the levels of paraoxonase, an antioxidant enzyme which protects LDL particles from oxidative modifications.\\n\\nProperties of the strain ME-3 can serve to classify it as a probiotic that has the ability to protect its host against food-derived infections and also help in the prevention of oxidative damage of food. Its multi-abilities have been tested and proven. Mice treated with a combination of ofloxacin and ME-3 revealed a reduction in liver and spleen granulomas of Salmonella Typhimurium.\\nME-3 is commercialized in the US, in Europe and in Asia in dietary supplement products for cardiovascular health, immune support or detoxification, under the brandname Reg\\'Activ.\\n\\nSafety\\nIn general, lactobacilli have been considered safe because of their association with food and because they are normal inhabitants of the human microbiota. They have also been identified to have a low pathogenic potential further reinforcing the idea that they are safe microbes.\\n\\nRecent research in regards to the safety of L. fermentum has been carried out on mice. Mice were fed (intragastrically) different concentrations of  L. fermentum  while a control group was also observed. After twenty-eight days blood samples were taken from the mice and analyzed. There was no health difference observed between the control mice and those fed L.fermentum in terms of blood biochemistry, protein, albumin, glucose, and cholesterol. Also no negative side effects during the experiment such as change in body weight, feed intake, or clinical signs such as diarrhea and ruffled fur, were observed. The ingestion of L. fermentum in mice appeared safe which led to further support that the use of L. fermentum in food is also safe.\\n\\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum has been identified in a rare case of cholecystitis  but is included in the EFSA list of bacteria with qualified presumed safety (QPS).\\n\\nTransferable resistance genes\\nOne important consideration to determine the safety of L. fermentum is transferable resistant genes. In order for  L. fermentum to be considered as a potential probiotic, it must not contain any transferable antibiotic resistance genes. If a resistance gene is transferable, it could lessen the effect of the use of antibiotics. Out of ten common antibiotic genes that were tested (gatamicin, cefazolin, penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole, ampicillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and norfloxacin), L. fermentum was found to only be resistant to amikacin and norfloxacin. Others studies have reported that most LABs are also resistant to these antibiotics, which led to the conclusion that it was a common characteristic of LABs. The resistance to these antibiotics can be considered natural or intrinsic. So far no observed L. fermentum strains have been observed to have transferable resistance or acquired resistance genes.\\n\\nDairy products\\nExperiments conducted by introducing the strain ME-3 of L. fermentum into dairy products as a probiotic ingredient revealed that it was able to suppress the reputed contaminants of food such as pathogenic Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and urinary tract infections that are caused by E. coli  and Staphylococcus spp. Also the introduction of  L. fermentum strains such as ME-3 in goat milk revealed that it was actually favorable to the host, resulting in an increase in number of beneficial lactobacilli.\\n\\nHeat resistance\\nAlthough LABs have been associated with potential health advantages, they are also responsible for negative outcomes. They are the main organisms involved in the spoilage of tomato products. Lactobacilli have been identified to be the causative organisms. Research was carried out to observe the chemical constituents of tomato juice that stimulate the growth of bacteria that are responsible for the spoilage. These bacteria can resist high temperatures. A strain of L. fermentum was extracted from a tomato juice concentrate. Meanwhile, eight different tomato juice mixtures were heated and the survival rate of L. fermentum was measured. It was concluded that pectins are the main tomato juice constituents that protect the bacteria cells against destruction from heating. The breakdown of pectin from enzymic action would make the bacteria cells more susceptible to heat. However, it was found in previous research that heating had inactivated natural pectolytic enzymes and therefore L. fermentum  remained heat resistant. Heat resistance has also been found to correlate with the medium in which the bacteria are cultured, the better the medium used will result in a higher resistance to heat.\\n\\nAntibiotic resistance\\nStudies have shown that L. fermentum has antibiotic resistances. L. fermentum is inherently vancomycin resistant, as are all other Lactobacillaceae with exception of species in the genera Lactobacillus, Holzapfelia and Amylolactobacillus.  DNA was isolated from  L. fermentum and tested for antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents by using broth dilution tests. Different strains of L. fermentum demonstrated uniform resistance patterns demonstrating resistance to glycopeptide and to tetracycline.\\n\\nDrug resistance plasmids\\nResearch done on L. fermentum strains has revealed the existence of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance plasmids.\\n\\nSensitivity to antibiotics\\nWhile  L. fermentum has been found to have antibiotic resistant properties, other studies have demonstrated that strains of the species are sensitive to some common antibiotics such as gentamicin, cefazolin, penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, amikacin, and cholorampehnicol.\\n\\nSee also\\n Lactobacillus\\n Lactic Acid Bacteria\\n Probiotic\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nType strain of Lactobacillus fermentum at BacDive -  the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase\\n\\nProbiotics\\nLactobacillaceae\\nBacteria described in 1901',\n",

It was reclassified as a new genus in 1960 when strains were found to be distinct enough from Neisseria to require a new genus. The name was suggested based on the organism being a diplococcus and gemellus is the diminutive of geminus, which is Latin for twin. They are facultatively anaerobic and give negative reactions to both oxidase and catalase tests. They are obligately fermentative, producing either a mixture of acetic and lactic acids or an equimolar molar mixture of acetic acid and CO2. For example, G. haemolysans ferments glucose forming a mixture of acetic and lactic acids in the absence of oxygen, whereas when oxygen is present, it forms acetic acid and CO2.\\n\\nClinical importance\\n\\nGemella bacteria are primarily found in the mucous membranes of humans and other animals, particularly in the oral cavity and upper digestive tract. Gemella haemolysans has been found to be involved in pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients. As of the year 2000 it had been reported in 15 cases of human endocarditis, mainly in men with underlying valvular disease and/or poor dentition or dental manipulation. Most cases were treated with a combination of penicillin and gentamicin with a favorable outcome. Additionally, Gemella asaccharolytica in bacterial vaginosis is associated with increase risk of HIV infection in unprotected sex.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBacillales\\nBacteria genera'],\n",

It is named after its discoverer, Sir Ewart Jones.  The reaction was an early method for the oxidation of alcohols.  Its use has subsided because milder, more selective reagents have been developed, e.g. Collins reagent.\\n\\nJones reagent is a solution prepared by dissolving chromium trioxide in aqueous sulfuric acid.  To effect a Jones oxidation, this acidic mixture is then added to an acetone solution of the substrate. Alternatively, potassium dichromate can be used in place of chromium trioxide. The oxidation is very rapid and quite exothermic.  Yields are typically high. The reagent is convenient and cheap. However, Cr(VI) compounds are carcinogenic, which deters the use of this methodology.\\n\\nStoichiometry and mechanism\\nJones reagent will convert primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. Depending on the reaction conditions, the aldehydes may then be converted to carboxylic acids. For oxidations to the aldehydes and ketones, two equivalents of chromic acid oxidize three equivalents of the alcohol:\\n 2 HCrO4−  +  3 RR\\'C(OH)H  +  8 H+  +  4 H2O   →   2 [Cr(H2O)6]3+  +  3 RR\\'CO\\n\\nFor oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, 4 equivalents of chromic acid oxidize 3 equivalents of the alcohol. The aldehyde is an intermediate.\\n4 HCrO4− + 3 RCH2OH + 16 H+ + 11 H2O → 4 [Cr(H2O)6]3+ + 3 RCOOH\\nThe inorganic products are green, characteristic of chromium(III) aquo complexes.\\n\\nLike many other oxidations of alcohols by metal oxides, the reaction proceeds via the formation of a mixed chromate ester: These esters have the formula CrO3(OCH2R)−\\nCrO3(OH)− + RCH2OH → CrO3(OCH2R)− + H2O\\nLike conventional esters, the formation of this chromate ester is accelerated by the acid.  These esters can be isolated when the alcohol is tertiary because these lack the α hydrogen that would be lost to form the carbonyl.  For example, using tert-butyl alcohol, one can isolate tert-butyl chromate ((CH3)3CO)2CrO2), which is itself a good oxidant.\\n\\nFor those structures with hydrogen alpha to the oxygen, the chromate esters degrade, releasing the carbonyl product and an ill-defined Cr(IV) product:\\nCrO3(OCH2R)− → \"CrO2OH−\" + O=CHR\\nThe deuterated alcohols HOCD2R oxidize about six times slower than the undeuterated derivatives.  This large kinetic isotope effect shows that the C–H (or C–D) bond breaks in the rate-determining step. \\n\\nThe reaction stoichiometry implicates the Cr(IV) species \"CrO2OH−\", which comproportionates with the chromic acid to give a Cr(V) oxide, which also functions as an oxidant for the alcohol.\\n\\nThe oxidation of the aldehydes is proposed to proceed via the formation of hemiacetal-like intermediates, which arise from the addition of the O3CrO-H− bond across the C=O bond.\\n\\nThe reagent rarely oxidizes unsaturated bonds.\\n\\nIllustrative reactions and applications\\nIt remains useful in organic synthesis.

       "       'Nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization is a method of radical polymerization that makes use of an nitroxide initiator to generate polymers with well controlled stereochemistry and a very low dispersity. It is a type of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization.\\n\\nAlkoxyamine Initiators \\nThe initiating materials for nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMP) are a family of compounds referred to as alkoxyamines. An alkoxyamine can essentially be viewed as an alcohol bound to a secondary amine by an N-O single bond. The utility of this functional group is that under certain conditions, homolysis of the C-O bond can occur, yielding a stable radical in the form of a 2-center 3-electron N-O system and a carbon radical which serves as an initiator for radical polymerization. For the purposes of NMP, the R groups attached to the nitrogen are always bulky, sterically hindering groups and the R group in the O- position forms a stable radical, generally is benzylic for polymerization to occur successfully. NMP allows for excellent control of chain length and structure, as well as a relative lack of true termination that allows polymerization to continue as long as there is available monomer. Because of this it is said to be “living\".\\n\\nPersistent radical effect \\nThe living nature of NMP is due to the persistent radical effect (PRE). The PRE is a phenomenon observable in some radical systems which leads to the highly favored formation of one product to the near exclusion of other radical couplings due to one of the radical species being particularly stable, existing in greater and greater concentrations as the reaction progresses while the other one is transient, reacting quickly with either itself in a termination step or with the persistent radical to form a desired product. As time goes on, a higher concentration of the persistent radical is present, which couples reversibly with itself, meaning that any of the transient radical still present tends to couple with the persistent radical rather than itself due to greater availability. This leads to a greater proportion of cross-coupling than self-coupling in radical species.\\n\\nIn the case of a nitroxide-mediated polymerization reaction, the persistent radical is the nitroxide species and the transient radical is always the carbon radical. This leads to repeated coupling of the nitroxide to the growing end of the polymer chain, which would ordinarily be considered a termination step, but is in this case reversible. Because of the high rate of coupling of the nitroxide to the growing chain end, there is little coupling of two active growing chains, which would be an irreversible terminating step limiting the chain length. The nitroxide binds and unbinds to the growing chain, protecting it from termination steps. This ensures that any available monomer can be easily scavenged by active chains. Because this polymerization process does not naturally self-terminate, this polymerization process is described as “living,” as the chains continue to grow under suitable reaction conditions whenever there is reactive monomer to “feed” them. Because of the PRE, it can be assumed that at any given time, almost all of the growing chains are “capped” by a mediating nitroxide, meaning that they dissociate and grow at very similar rates, creating a largely uniform chain length and structure.\\n\\nNitroxide stability\\nAs stated above, nitroxide radicals are effective mediators of well-controlled radical polymerization because they are quite stable, allowing them to act as persistent radicals in a reaction mixture. This stability is a result of their unique structure. In most diagrams, the radical is depicted on the oxygen, but another resonance structure exists which is more helpful in explaining their stability in which the radical is on the nitrogen, which has a double bond to the oxygen. In addition to this resonance stability, nitroxides used in NMRP always contain bulky, sterically hindering groups in the R1 and R2 positions. The significant steric bulk of these substituents entirely prevents radical coupling in the N-centered resonance form while significantly reducing it in the O-centered form. These bulky groups contribute stability, but only if there is no resonance provided by allyl or aromatic groups α to the N. These result in decreased stability of the nitroxide, presumably because they offer less sterically hindered sites for radical coupling to take place. The resulting inactivity of the radical makes hemolytic cleavage of the alkoxyamine quite fast in more sterically hindered species.\\n\\nNitroxide choice \\nThe choice of a specific nitroxide species to use has a large effect on the efficacy of an attempted polymerization. An effective polymerization (fast rate of chain growth, consistent chain length) results from a nitroxide with a fast C-O homolysis and relatively few side reactions. A more polar solvent lends itself better to C-O homolysis, so polar solvents which cannot bind to a labile nitroxide are the most effective for NMP. It is generally agreed that the structural factor that has the greatest effect on the ability of a nitroxide to mediate a radical polymerization is steric bulk. Generally speaking, greater steric bulk on the nitroxide leads to greater strain on the alkoxyamine, leading to the most easily broken bond, the C-O single bond, cleaving homolytically.\\n\\nRing size \\nIn the case of cyclic nitroxides, five-membered ring systems have been shown to cleave more slowly than six-membered rings and acyclic nitroxides with t-butyl moieties as their R groups cleaved fastest of all. This difference in the rate of cleavage was determined to result not from a difference in C-O bond lengths, but in the difference of C-O-N bond angle in the alkoxyamine. The smaller the bond angle the greater the steric interaction between the nitroxide and the alkyl fragment and the more easily the initiator species broke apart.\\n\\nSteric bulk \\nThe efficiency of polymerization increases more and more with increased steric bulk of the nitroxide up to a point. TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) is capable of inducing the polymerization of styrene and styrene derivatives fairly easily, but is not sufficiently labile to induce polymerization of butyl acrylate under most conditions. TEMPO derivatives with even bulkier groups at the positions α to N have a rate of homolysis great enough to induce NMP of butyl acrylate, and the bulkier the α groups, the faster polymerization occurs. This indicates that the steric bulk of the nitroxide fragment can be a good indicator of the strength of an alkoxyamine initiator, at least up to a point.  The equilibrium of its homolysis and reformation favors the radical form to the extent that recombination to reform an alkoxyamine over the course of NMP occurs too slowly to maintain control of chain length.\\n\\nPreparation methods \\nBecause TEMPO, which is commercially available, is a sufficient nitroxide mediator for the synthesis of polystyrene derivatives, the preparation of alkoxyamine initiators for NMP of copolymers is in many cases a matter of attaching a nitroxide group (TEMPO) to a specifically synthesized alkyl fragment. Several methods have been reported to achieve this transformation.\\n\\nJacobsen\\'s catalyst\\nJacobsen\\'s catalyst is a manganese-based catalyst commonly used for the stereoselective epoxidation of alkenes. This epoxidation proceeds by a radical addition mechanism, which can be taken advantage of by introducing the radical TEMPO group into the reaction mixture. After treatment with a mild reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, this yields the product of a Markovnikov addition of nitroxide to the alkene. Jacobsen’s catalyst is fairly mild, and a wide variety of functionalities on the alkene substrate can be tolerated. Practical yields are not necessarily as high as those reported by Dao et al., however.\\n\\nHydrazine\\nAn alternative method is to react a substrate with a C-Br bond at the desired location of the nitroxide with hydrazine, generating an alkyl substituted hydrazine which is then exposed to a nitroxide radical and a mild oxidating agent such as lead dioxide. This generates a carbon-centered radical which couples with the nitroxide to generate the desired alkoxyamine. This method has the disadvantage of being relatively inefficient for some species, as well as the inherent danger of having to work with extremely toxic hydrazine and the inconvenience of having to run reactions in inert atmosphere.\\n\\nTreatment of aldehydes with hydrogen peroxide\\nYet another published alkoxyamine synthesis involves treatment of aldehydes with hydrogen peroxide, which adds to the carbonyl group. The resulting species rearranges in situ in the presence of CuCl forming formic acid and the desired alkyl radical, which couples with tempo to produce the target alkoxyamine. The reaction appears to give fairly good yields and tolerates a variety of functional groups in the alkyl chain.\\n\\nElectrophilic bromination and nucleophilic attack\\nA synthesis has been described by Moon and Kang consisting of a one-electron reduction of a nitroxide radical in metallic sodium to yield a nucleophilic nitroxide. The nitroxide nucleophile is then added to an appropriate alkyl bromide, yielding the alkoxyamine by a simple SN2 reaction. This technique has the advantage of requiring only the appropriate alkyl bromide to be synthesized without requiring inconvenient reaction conditions and extremely hazardous reagents like Braso et al.’s method.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nPolymerization reactions',\n",
       "       \"The Saegusa–Ito oxidation is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry. It was discovered in 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as a method to introduce α-β unsaturation in carbonyl compounds. The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone. The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1,4-addition with nucleophiles such as organocuprates.\\n\\nFor acyclic substrates the reaction yields the thermodynamic E-olefin product exclusively.\\n\\nThis discovery was preceded nearly eight years earlier by a report that treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields. The major improvement provided by Saegusa and Ito was the recognition that the enol form was the reactive species, developing a method based on silyl enol ethers.\\n\\nBenzoquinone is actually not a necessary component for this reaction; its role is to regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while at a much higher cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some progress has been made in the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.\\n\\nMechanism\\nThe mechanism of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It has been shown that the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.\\n\\nScope\\nThe wide applicability of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation is exemplified by its use in  several classic syntheses of complex molecules. The synthesis of morphine by Tohru Fukuyama in 2006 is one such example, in which the transformation tolerates the presence of carbamate and ether substituents.\\n\\nSamuel J. Danishefsky's synthesis of both (+) and (-) peribysin began with a Saegusa–Ito oxidation of the Diels-Alder adduct of carvone and 3-trimethylsilyloxy-1,3-butadiene to yield the enone below. In this case the oxidation tolerated the presence of alkene and carbonyl moieties.\\n\\nYong Qiang Tu's synthesis of the Alzheimer's disease medication galantamine likewise used this reaction in the presence of an acid-sensitive acetal group.\\n\\nLarry E. Overman's synthesis of laurenyne utilizes a one-pot oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate followed by a Saegusa oxidation, tolerating the presence of a halogen and a sulfonate.\\n\\nThe synthesis of sambutoxin reported by David Williams uses a novel Saegusa–Ito oxidation involving an unprotected enol moiety. The enone product cyclized in situ to regenerate the enol and form the tetrahydropyran ring. Subsequent deprotection of the methoxymethyl group furnished the natural product.\\n\\nVariations\\nThe vast majority of improvements to this reaction have focused on rendering the transformation catalytic with respect to the palladium salt, primarily due to its high cost. The original conditions, though technically catalytic, still require 50\\xa0mol% of palladium(II) acetate, raising the cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses.\\n\\nThe major advances in catalytic versions of this reaction have steered towards co-oxidants that regenerate the palladium(II) species effectively. Specifically, conditions using atmospheric oxygen as well as stoichiometric allylcarbonate have been developed.\\n\\nWith respect to the former, the method developed by Larock in 1995 represents an environmentally and cost-attractive method as a catalytic substitute for the Saegusa–Ito oxidation.\\n\\nThis method suffers from long reaction times and often produces significantly lower yields than the stoichiometric equivalent as showcased in the synthesis of platyphillide by Nishida. The contrast of the two methods highlights the catalytic method's shortcomings.\\n\\nCatalytic variants employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate and other allylic carbonates have also been developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce α-allylketones instead.\\n\\nThis latter method has enjoyed greater success as a synthetic tool, most notably in the Shibasaki total synthesis of the famous poison strychnine.\\n\\nDespite these methods, much work remains to be done with regard to catalytic installation of α-β unsaturation.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Silyl enol ether\\n Palladium(II) acetate\\n Selenoxide elimination\\n Galantamine total synthesis\\n Strychnine total synthesis\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nName reactions\",\n",
       "       'An alkoxide is the conjugate base of an alcohol\\nand therefore consists of an organic group bonded to a negatively charged oxygen atom.  They are written as RO−, where R is the organic substituent.  Alkoxides are strong bases and, when R is not bulky, good nucleophiles and good ligands. Alkoxides, although generally not stable in protic solvents such as water, occur widely as intermediates in various reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis.  Transition metal alkoxides are widely used for coatings and as catalysts.\\n\\nEnolates are unsaturated alkoxides derived by deprotonation of a C-H bond adjacent to a ketone or aldehyde.  The nucleophilic center for simple alkoxides is located on the oxygen, whereas the nucleophilic site on enolates is delocalized onto both carbon and oxygen sites. Ynolates are also unsaturated alkoxides derived from acetylenic alcohols.\\n\\nPhenoxides are close relatives of the alkoxides, in which the alkyl group is replaced by a derivative of benzene.  Phenol is more acidic than a typical alcohol; thus, phenoxides are correspondingly less basic and less nucleophilic than alkoxides.  They are, however, often easier to handle, and yield derivatives that are more crystalline than those of the alkoxides.\\n\\nStructure\\nAlkali metal alkoxides are often oligomeric or polymeric compounds, especially when the R group is small (Me, Et).  The alkoxide anion is a good bridging ligand, thus many alkoxides feature M2O or M3O linkages.  In solution, the alkali metal derivatives exhibit strong ion-pairing, as expected for the alkali metal derivative of a strongly basic anion.\\n\\nPreparation\\n\\nBy metathesis reactions\\nMany alkoxides are prepared by salt-forming reactions from a metal chloride and sodium alkoxide:\\nn\\xa0NaOR \\xa0 + \\xa0 MCln \\xa0 → \\xa0 M(OR)n \\xa0 + \\xa0 n\\xa0NaCl\\nSuch reactions are favored by the lattice energy of the NaCl, and purification of the product alkoxide is simplified by the fact that NaCl is insoluble in common organic solvents.\\n\\nFor some electrophilic metal halides, conversion to the alkoxide requires no base. Titanium tetrachloride reacts with alcohols to give the corresponding tetraalkoxides, concomitant with the evolution of hydrogen chloride:\\nTiCl4 \\xa0 + \\xa0 4\\xa0(CH3)2CHOH \\xa0 → \\xa0 Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 \\xa0 + \\xa0 4\\xa0HCl\\nThe reaction can be accelerated by the addition of a base, such as a tertiary amine.  Many other metal and main group halides can be used instead of titanium, for example SiCl4, ZrCl4, and PCl3.\\n\\nFrom reducing metals\\nAlkoxides can be produced by several routes starting from an alcohol.  Highly reducing metals react directly with alcohols to give the corresponding metal alkoxide.  The alcohol serves as an acid, and hydrogen is produced as a by-product.  A classic case is sodium methoxide produced by the addition of sodium metal to methanol:\\n\\n2\\xa0CH3OH \\xa0 + \\xa0 2\\xa0Na \\xa0 → \\xa0 2\\xa0CH3ONa \\xa0 + \\xa0 H2\\n\\nOther alkali metals can be used in place of sodium, and most alcohols can be used in place of methanol. Another similar reaction occurs when an alcohol is reacted with a metal hydride such as NaH. The metal hydride removes the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group and forms a negatively charged alkoxide ion.\\n\\nBy electrochemical processes\\nMany alkoxides can be prepared by anodic dissolution of the corresponding metals in water-free alcohols in the presence of electroconductive additive. The metals may be Co, Ga, Ge, Hf, Fe, Ni, Nb, Mo, La, Re, Sc, Si, Ti,   Ta, W, Y, Zr, etc. The conductive additive may be lithium chloride, quaternary ammonium halide, or other. Some examples of metal alkoxides obtained by this technique: Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, Nb2(OCH3)10, Ta2(OCH3)10, [MoO(OCH3)4]2, Re2O3(OCH3)6, Re4O6(OCH3)12, and Re4O6(OCH(CH3)2)10.\\n\\nProperties\\n\\nReactions with alkyl halides\\nThe alkoxide ion can react with a primary alkyl halide in an SN2 reaction to form an ether via the Williamson Ether Synthesis.\\n\\nHydrolysis and transesterification\\nAliphatic metal alkoxides decompose in water:\\n\\n2\\xa0LnMOR \\xa0 + \\xa0 H2O \\xa0 → \\xa0 [LnM]2O \\xa0 + \\xa0 2\\xa0ROH\\nwhere R is an organic substituent and L is an unspecified ligand (often an alkoxide).\\nA well-studied case is the irreversible hydrolysis of titanium ethoxide:\\n1/n\\xa0[Ti(OCH2CH3)4]n \\xa0 + \\xa0 2\\xa0H2O \\xa0 → \\xa0 TiO2 \\xa0 + \\xa0 4\\xa0HOCH2CH3\\nBy controlling the stoichiometry and steric properties of the alkoxide, such reactions can be arrested leading to metal-oxy-alkoxides, which usually are oligonuclear complexes.  Other alcohols can be employed in place of water.  In this way one alkoxide can be converted to another, and the process is properly referred to as alcoholysis (unfortunately, there is an issue of terminology confusion with transesterification, a different process - see below). The position of the equilibrium can be controlled by the acidity of the alcohol; for example phenols typically react with alkoxides to release alcohols, giving the corresponding phenoxide.  More simply, the alcoholysis can be controlled by selectively evaporating the more volatile component.  In this way, ethoxides can be converted to butoxides, since ethanol (b.p.\\xa078\\xa0°C) is more volatile than butanol (b.p.\\xa0118\\xa0°C).\\n\\nIn the transesterification process, metal alkoxides react with esters to bring about an exchange of alkyl groups between metal alkoxide and ester. With the metal alkoxide complex in focus, the result is the same as for alcoholysis, namely the replacement of alkoxide ligands, but at the same time the alkyl groups of the ester are changed, which can also be the primary goal of the reaction. Sodium methoxide, for example, is commonly used for this purpose, a reaction that is relevant to the production of \"bio-diesel\".\\n\\nFormation of oxo-alkoxides\\nMany metal alkoxide compounds also feature oxo-ligands. Oxo-ligands typically arise via the hydrolysis, often accidentally, and via ether elimination:\\n2\\xa0LnMOR \\xa0 → \\xa0 [LnM]2O \\xa0 + \\xa0 R2O\\n\\nAdditionally, low valent metal alkoxides are susceptible to oxidation by air\\n\\nFormation of polynuclear and heterometallic derivatives\\nCharacteristically, transition metal alkoxides are polynuclear, that is they contain more than one metal.  Alkoxides are sterically undemanding and highly basic ligands that tend to bridge metals.\\n\\nUpon the isomorphic substitution of metal atoms close in properties crystalline complexes of variable composition are formed. The metal ratio in such compounds can vary over a broad range. For instance, the substitution of molybdenum and tungsten for rhenium in the complexes Re4O6−y(OCH3)12+y allowed one to obtain complexes Re4−xMoxO6−y(OCH3)12+y in the range 0\\xa0≤\\xa0x\\xa0≤\\xa02.82 and Re4−xWxO6−y(OCH3)12+y in the range 0\\xa0≤\\xa0x\\xa0≤\\xa02.\\n\\nThermal stability\\nMany metal alkoxides thermally decompose in the range ~100–300\\xa0°C. Depending on process conditions, this thermolysis can afford nanosized powders of oxide or metallic phases. This approach is a basis of processes of fabrication of functional materials intended for aircraft, space, electronic fields, and chemical industry: individual oxides, their solid solutions, complex oxides, powders of metals and alloys active towards sintering.  Decomposition of mixtures of mono- and heterometallic alkoxide derivatives has also been examined. This method represents a prospective approach possessing an advantage of capability of obtaining functional materials with increased phase and chemical homogeneity and controllable grain size (including the preparation of nanosized materials) at relatively low temperature (less than 500−900\\xa0°C) as compared with the conventional techniques.\\n\\nIllustrative alkoxides\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFunctional groups\\nBases (chemistry)\\n \\nCoordination chemistry',\n",
       "       'The Sarett oxidation is an organic reaction that oxidizes primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, using chromium trioxide and pyridine. Unlike the similar Jones oxidation, the Sarett oxidation will not further oxidize primary alcohols to their carboxylic acid form, neither will it affect carbon-carbon double bonds. Use of the original Sarett oxidation has become largely antiquated however,  in favor of other modified oxidation techniques. The unadulterated reaction is still occasionally used in teaching settings and in small scale laboratory research.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nFirst appearance\\n\\nThe reaction is named after the American chemist Lewis Hastings Sarett (1917–1999). The first description of its use appears in a 1953 article  co-authored by Sarett that relates to the synthesis of adrenal steroids. The paper proposes the use of the pyridine chromium complex  CrO3-2C5H5N to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols. The complex would later become known as the \"Sarett Reagent\".\\n\\nModifications and improvements\\nAlthough the Sarett reagent gives good yields of ketones, its conversion of primary alcohols is less efficient. Furthermore, the isolation of products from the reaction solution can be difficult. These limitations were partially addressed with the introduction of the Collins oxidation.  The active ingredient in both the Sarett reagent is identical to that in the so-called \"Collins reagent\", i.e. the pyridine complex (CrO3(C5H5N)2. The Collins oxidation varies from the Sarett oxidation only in that it uses methylene chloride as instead of neat pyridine. The initially proposed methods of executing the Collins and Sarett oxidations were still not ideal however, as the Sarett reagent\\'s hygroscopic, and pyrophoric properties make it difficult to prepare. This issues lead to an improvement  of the Collins oxidation protocol known as the Ratcliffe variant.\\n\\nPreparation of the Sarett reagent\\n\\nTechniques\\n\\nThe Sarett reagent was originally prepared in 1953 by addition of chromium trioxide to pyridine. The pyridine must be cooled because the reaction is dangerously exothermic. Slowly, the brick-red CrO3 transform into the bis(pyridine) adduct. Subsequent to the conversion to the Sarett reagent, it is immediately used.\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nThe specific methods of the reagent\\'s preparation are critical, as improper technique can cause the explosion of the materials. Some technical improvements to the original methodology have reduced the risks associated with preparation. One such recent improvement reduced the likelihood of explosion by using chromic anhydride granules that would immediately sink below the surface of the cooled pyridine upon addition. It should also be mentioned that chromium trioxide is a corrosive carcinogen and therefore must be handled with extreme care.\\n\\nCollins technique\\nThe original Collins oxidation calls for the Sarett reagent to be removed from the excess pyridine and dissolved in the less basic methylene chloride. While the new solvent improves the overall yield of the reaction, it also requires the dangerous transfer of the pyrophoric reagent.  The 1970 Ratcliffe variation reduced the risk of explosion by calling for the Sarett reagent to be made in situ. This was achieved by creating the Sarett reagent according to the original protocol using a stirred mixture of pyridine and methylene chloride.\\n\\nSpecific applications\\nThe Sarett oxidation efficiently oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes without further oxidizing them to carboxylic acids. This key difference from the Jones oxidation is due to the fact that the Jones oxidation occurs in the presence of water, which adds to the alcohol following oxidation to an aldehyde. The Sarett and Collins oxidations occur in the absence of water.  The Sarett oxidation also proceeds under basic conditions, which allows for the use of acid sensitive substrates, such as those containing certain protecting groups. This is dissimilar to other common acidic oxidation reactions such as the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which would remove or alter such groups. Additionally, the Sarett reagent is relatively inert towards double bonds and thioether groups. These groups cannot effectively interact with the chromium of the Sarett reagent, as compared to the chromium in oxidizing complexes used prior to 1953.\\n\\nSee also\\n Pyridinium chlorochromate\\n Jones oxidation\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nSarett oxidation\\n\\nOrganic oxidation reactions\\nName reactions',\n",
       "       'The oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones is an important oxidation reaction in organic chemistry.\\n\\nWhere a secondary alcohol is oxidised, it is converted to a ketone. The hydrogen from the hydroxyl group is lost along with the hydrogen bonded to the carbon attached to oxygen. The remaining oxygen then forms double bonds with the carbon. This leaves a ketone, as R1–COR2. Ketones are quite resistant to further oxidation as it would require breaking an adjacent C–C bond, but with strong oxidants this may occur and produces esters or carboxylic acids.\\n\\nThe reaction can occur using a variety of oxidants.\\n\\nPotassium dichromate\\n\\nA secondary alcohol can be oxidised into a ketone using acidified potassium dichromate and heating under reflux.\\nThe orange-red dichromate ion, Cr2O72−, is reduced to the green Cr3+ ion.

       "       'A photooxygenation is a light-induced oxidation reaction in which molecular oxygen is incorporated into the product(s). Initial research interest in photooxygenation reactions arose from Oscar Raab\\'s observations in 1900 that the combination of light, oxygen and photosensitizers is highly toxic to cells. Early studies of photooxygenation focused on oxidative damage to DNA and amino acids, but recent research has led to the application of photooxygenation in organic synthesis and photodynamic therapy.\\n\\nPhotooxygenation reactions are initiated by a photosensitizer, which is a molecule that enters an excited state when exposed to light of a specific wavelength (e.g. dyes and pigments). The excited sensitizer then reacts with either a substrate or ground state molecular oxygen, starting a cascade of energy transfers that ultimately result in an oxygenated molecule. Consequently, photooxygenation reactions are categorized by the type and order of these intermediates (as type I, type II, or type III reactions).\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nTerminology\\nPhotooxygenation reactions are easily confused with a number of processes baring similar names (i.e. photosensitized oxidation). Clear distinctions can be made based on three attributes: oxidation, the involvement of light, and the incorporation of molecular oxygen into the products:\\n\\nSensitizers\\n\\nSensitizers (denoted \"Sens\") are compounds, such as fluorescein dyes, methylene blue, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are able to absorb electromagnetic radiation (usually in the visible range of the spectrum) and eventually transfer that energy to molecular oxygen or the substrate of photooxygenation process. Many sensitizers, both naturally occurring and synthetic, rely on extensive aromatic systems to absorb light in the visible spectrum.   When sensitizers are excited by light, they reach a singlet state, 1Sens*. This singlet is then converted into a triplet state (which is more stable), 3Sens*, via intersystem crossing. The 3Sens* is what reacts with either the substrate or 3O2 in the three types of photooxygenation reactions.\\nSens ->[hv] {^1Sens^\\\\ast} -> {^3Sens^\\\\ast}\\n\\nStates of molecular oxygen\\n\\nIn classical Lewis structures, molecular oxygen, O2, is depicted as having a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. However, the molecular orbitals of O2 are actually more complex than Lewis structures seem to suggest. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of O2  is a pair of degenerate antibonding π orbitals, π2px* and π2py*, which are both singly occupied by spin unpaired electrons. These electrons are the cause of O2 being a triplet diradical in the ground state (indicated as 3O2).\\n\\nWhile many stable molecules’ HOMOs consist of bonding molecular orbitals and therefore require a moderate energy jump from bonding to antibonding to reach their first excited state, the antibonding nature of molecular oxygen’s HOMO allows for a lower energy gap between its ground state and first excited state. This makes excitation of O2 a less energetically restrictive process. In the first excited state of O2, a 22 kcal/mol energy increase from the ground state, both electrons in the antibonding orbitals occupy a degenerate π* orbital, and oxygen is now in a singlet state (indicated as 1O2). 1O2 is very reactive with a lifetime between 10-100µs.\\n\\nTypes of photooxygenation \\nThe three types of photooxygenation reactions are distinguished by the mechanisms that they proceed through, as they are capable of yielding different or similar products depending on environmental conditions. Type I and II reactions proceed through neutral intermediates, while type III reactions proceed through charged species. The absence or presence of 1O2 is what distinguishes type I and type II reactions, respectively.\\n\\nType I \\nIn type I reactions, the photoactivated 3Sens* interacts with the substrate to yield a radical substrate, usually through the homolytic bond breaking of a hydrogen bond on the substrate.  This substrate radical then interacts with 3O2  (ground state) to yield a substrate-O2 radical.  Such a radical is generally quenched by abstracting a hydrogen from another substrate molecule or from the solvent. This process allows for chain propagation of the reaction.\\n\\nExample: Oxygen trapping of diradical intermediates \\nType I photooxygenation reactions are frequently used in the process of forming and trapping diradical species. Mirbach et al. reported on one such reaction in which an azo compound is lysed via photolysis to form the diradical hydrocarbon and then trapped in a stepwise fashion by molecular oxygen:\\n\\nType II \\nIn type II reactions, the 3Sens* transfers its energy directly with 3O2 via a radiation-less transition to create 1O2. 1O2 then adds to the substrate in a variety of ways including: cycloadditions (most commonly [4+2]), addition to double bonds to yield 1,2-dioxetanes, and ene reactions with olefins.\\n\\nExample: precursor to prostaglandin synthesis\\nThe [4+2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen to cyclopentadiene to create cis-2-cyclopentene-1,4-diol is a common step involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins. The initial addition singlet oxygen, through the concerted [4+2] cycloaddition, forms an unstable endoperoxide. Subsequent reduction of the peroxide bound produces the two alcohol groups.\\n\\nType III \\nIn type III reactions, there is an electron transfer that occurs between the 3Sens* and the substrate resulting in an anionic Sens and a cationic substrate.  Another electron transfer then occurs where the anionic Sens transfers an electron to 3O2 to form the superoxide anion, O2−. This transfer returns the Sens to its ground state. The superoxide anion and cationic substrate then interact to form the oxygenated product.\\n\\nExample: indolizine photooxygenation\\nPhotooxygenation of indolizines (heterocyclic aromatic derivates of indole) has been investigated in both mechanistic and synthetic contexts. Rather than proceeding through a Type I or Type II photooxygenation mechanism, some investigators have chosen to use 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) as a photosensitzer, leading to the reaction of an indolizine derivative with the superoxide anion radical. Note that the reaction proceeds through an indolizine radical cation intermediate that has not been isolated (and thus is not depicted):\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nOrganic synthesis\\n\\nAll 3 types of photooxygenation have been applied in the context of organic synthesis. In particular, type II photooxygenations have proven to be the most widely used (due to the low amount of energy required to generate singlet oxygen) and have been described as \"one of the most powerful methods for the photochemical oxyfunctionalization of organic compounds.\" These reactions can proceed in all common solvents and with a broad range of sensitizers.\\n\\nMany of the applications of type II photooxygenations in organic synthesis come from\\nWaldemar Adam\\'s investigations into the ene-reaction of singlet oxygen with acyclic alkenes. Through the cis effect and the presence of appropriate steering groups the reaction can even provide high regioselectively and diastereoselectivity - two valuable stereochemical controls.\\n\\nPhotodynamic therapy\\n\\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) uses photooxygenation to destroy cancerous tissue.  A photosensitizer is injected into the tumor and then specific wavelengths of light are exposed to the tissue to excite the Sens. The excited Sens generally follows a type I or II photooxygenation mechanism to result in oxidative damage to cells. Extensive oxidative damage to tumor cells will kill tumor cells. Also oxidative damage to nearby blood vessels will cause local agglomeration and cut off nutrient supply to the tumor, thus starving the tumor.\\n\\nAn important consideration when selecting the Sens to be used in PDT is the specific wavelength of light the Sens will absorb to reach an excited state. Since the maximum penetration of tissues is achieved around wavelengths of 800\\xa0nm, selecting Sens that absorb around this range is advantageous as it allows for PDT to be affective on tumors beneath the outer most layer of the dermis. The window of 800\\xa0nm light is most effective at penetrating tissues because at wavelengths shorter than 800\\xa0nm the light starts to be scattered by the macromolecules of cells and at wavelengths longer than 800\\xa0nm water molecules will begin to absorb the light and convert it into heat.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nReaction mechanisms\\nOrganic reactions\\nPhotochemistry',\n",
       "       \"Base-promoted epoxide isomerization is the conversion of alkyl epoxides to ring-opened products through the action of strong base. Isomerizations of this type are most often used to synthesize allylic alcohols, although other products are possible.\\n\\nIntroduction \\nIn the presence of lithium or aluminum amide bases, epoxides may open to give the corresponding allylic alcohols. Removal of a proton adjacent to the epoxide, elimination, and neutralization of the resulting alkoxide lead to synthetically useful allylic alcohol products. In reactions of chiral, non-racemic epoxides, the configuration of the allylic alcohol product matches that of the epoxide substrate at the carbon whose C–O bond does not break (the starred carbon below). Besides β-elimination some other reactions are possible, as metalation of the epoxide ring can take place competitively. Vinylogous eliminations are possible when the epoxide substrate is substituted with vinyl or dienyl groups. Unconstrained systems tend to form trans double bonds, as significant non-bonding interactions are avoided in the transition state for the formation of trans products (see equation (2) below). The strongly basic conditions required for most isomerizations of this type represent the reaction's primary disadvantage.\\n(1)\\n\\nMechanism and stereochemistry\\n\\nPrevailing mechanism \\nIsomerization of epoxides to allylic alcohols under strongly basic conditions proceeds by a β-elimination process. A model has been advanced that invokes an initial complex between the lithium amide base and epoxide. Concerted C–O bond cleavage and deprotonation proceeds via a syn transition state to give an allylic alkoxide, which is protonated upon workup. Deprotonation typically occurs at the exist in the transition state for cis double bond formation.\\n(2)\\nOther processes may take place competitively under basic conditions, particularly when β-elimination is slow or not possible. These pathways likely begin with lithiation of a carbon in the epoxide ring, followed by α-elimination to afford a carbene intermediate. 1,2-hydrogen migration leads to ketones, while intramolecular C–H insertion affords cyclic alcohols with the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.(3)\\nIn many cases when hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) is used as an additive with lithium amide bases, selectivity for the formation of allylic alcohols increases. These reactions are believed to proceed through E2 elimination.\\n\\nStereoselective variants \\nChiral amide bases may be used in catalytic amounts to isomerize meso epoxides to chiral allylic alcohols with high enantioselectivity.\\n(4)\\n\\nScope and limitations \\nTerminal epoxides suffer from the limitation that competitive nucleophilic addition of the base to the unsubstituted epoxide carbon may take place. Non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered bases have been used to isomerize terminal epoxides successfully, however.(5)\\nAcyclic disubstituted epoxides undergo deprotonation at the least substituted site (unless a conjugated double bond can be formed; see equation (9) below) with high selectivity for trans double bonds.\\n(6)\\nFive- and six-membered rings containing epoxides afford allylic alcohols upon treatment with amide bases; however, reactions of medium-ring epoxides may be complicated by competitive transannular C–H insertion or ketone formation.\\n(7)\\nTrisubstituted epoxides do not easily undergo metalation in the ring. As a result, allylic alcohols are formed from these substrates without competitive carbenoid transformations. The use of bulky aluminum amide bases facilitates elimination at the substituent cis to hydrogen, which occurs from the less sterically hindered epoxide-base complex.\\n(8)\\nSuitably substituted unsaturated epoxides may undergo vinylogous elimination, which leads to conjugated allylic alcohols. Substituted vinyl epoxides undergo 1,4-elimination in some but not all cases; however, epoxides with β unsaturation eliminate cleanly to give conjugated allylic alcohols.\\n(9)\\n\\nExperimental conditions and procedure\\n\\nTypical conditions \\nLithium amides are usually prepared in the laboratory through the addition of a titrated solution of n-butyllithium in hexanes to a solution of the amine in ether. Dry glassware and inert atmosphere are required for these reactions. Alternatively, lithium amides may be prepared by the direct action of lithium on the corresponding amine. Typical temperatures for isomerization reactions employing lithium amides are between 0\\xa0°C and reflux (ether/hexane solvent mixtures derived from the synthesis of the lithium amide are usually used directly for isomerization reactions). An excess of the base is employed to account for impurities that consume base and reaction of the base with the ether solvent. Care should be taken when HMPA is added to lithium amide reactions, as it is a known animal carcinogen.\\n\\nOrganolithium reagents may also be used; however, lower temperatures are required to avoid decomposition of the base. These reactions are most often run in hexanes.\\n\\nAluminum amides, which are bulkier and sometimes more selective than lithium amides, are prepared from the corresponding lithium amides and diethylaluminum chloride. Reactions are usually carried out at 0\\xa0°C in an inert atmosphere, with benzene as the solvent.\\n\\nExample procedure \\n(10)\\nA benzene solution of 1 eq of diethylaluminum chloride was added dropwise at 0° to a solution of 1 eq of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide prepared in the usual fashion in benzene.

The α-halo ketones are readily prepared from ketones by various ketone halogenation reactions, and the products are reactive intermediates that can be used for a variety of other chemical reactions.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThe reduction of α-halo ketones generates a variety of product structures that may exhibit unique substitution patterns and reactivity. For instance, reduction of α,α'-dihalo ketones leads to 2-oxyallyl metal complexes, which participate in [4+3] and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions as the 2π component. 2-Oxyallyl metal intermediates may also intercept nucleophiles in a process that involves umpolung at the α carbon. In addition, because reduction of monohalo ketones produces enolates in a site-specific fashion, reactions associated with enolates (alkylation, aldol, Michael) may be carried out using halo ketone substrates under reductive conditions.\\n(1)\\n\\nMechanism\\nMany reducing agents used in this type of reaction are commercially available. A few require preparation and immediate use, including zinc–copper couple and zinc/silver couples. and organocuprates\\n\\nMonohalo ketones\\nMonohalo ketones are reduced by both one-electron and two-electron reducing agents to afford the parent ketones, derivatives functionalized with electrophiles, or products of dimerization. The mechanism of reduction itself depends on the nature of the reducing agent.\\n\\nOne-electron reducing agents, such as d6 or d1 transition metal complexes, initially donate a single electron to the halo ketone. Fragmentation of the resulting radical anion yields an organic radical and halide anion. Donation of a second electron from a second equivalent of reducing agent leads to the formation of a metal enolate in which the oxidation state of the reducing agent has increased by one.\\n(2)\\nTwo-electron reducing agents, the most prominent of which is zinc metal, undergo direct oxidative addition to monohalo ketones to afford metal enolates in which the oxidation state of the metal has increased by two. Subsequent disproportionation with unreacted halo ketone sometimes leads to the formation of two equivalents of enol radical, which may subsequently dimerize.\\n(3)\\nTreatment of enolates derived from either one- or two-electron reducing agents with an electrophile affords α-functionalized ketones as the final product.\\n\\nα,α-Dihalo ketones\\nSimilar to monohalo ketones, geminal dihalo ketones initially form metal enolates upon exposure to one- or two-electron reducing agents. In the presence of a protic solvent, reduction stops at this stage to afford the monohalo ketone (which may be further reduced to the parent ketone). However, in the absence of a trapping electrophile or protic solvent, loss of the remaining halide from the enolate intermediate affords α-keto carbenes or carbenoids, which undergo C-H insertion reactions.\\n(4)\\n\\nα,α'-Dihalo ketones\\nInitial reduction of α,α'-dihalo ketones leads to metal enolate intermediates. Loss of the remaining halide generates 2-oxyallyl metal complexes, which undergo [4+3] and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions in the presence of dienes or olefins. Isomerization of 2-oxyallyl metal complexes to cyclopropanone and allene oxide forms is rapid and reversible; increasing the covalent character of the oxygen–metal bond favors the 2-oxyallyl isomer.\\n(5)\\n\\nScope and Limitations\\nReductions of α-halo ketones may afford the parent ketones, partially reduced halo ketones, or products arising from interception of intermediates along the reduction pathway with nucleophiles or electrophiles. The products obtained depend on both the reducing agent and the substitution pattern of the halo ketone.\\n\\nMonohalo ketones\\nMonohalo ketones may be reduced to the corresponding parent ketone with lithium metal, followed by protonation of the enolate. Other useful reducing agents for this transformation include lithium dialkylcuprates and molybdenum hexacarbonyl-alumina.\\n(6)\\nAlkylation of enolates generated through the reduction of monohalo ketones is limited to the most reactive alkyl halides. However, reduction in the presence of an aldehyde leads to reductive aldol products, analogous to the Reformatsky reaction of haloesters. Zinc dust may be used alone; or as an amalgam, in combination with diethylaluminum chloride, or with catalytic amounts of copper(I) bromide.\\n(7)\\nReductive dimerization may result from the combination of two intermediate α-acyl radicals or nucleophilic attack of a metal enolate on unreacted halo ketone. Although complex reaction mixtures often result, selective dimerization is possible in some cases. In the example below, the product distribution is solvent dependent\\n(8)\\n\\nα,α-Dihalo ketones\\nDepending on the conditions employed, geminal dihalo ketones may be reduced to the parent ketone, monohalo ketone, or functionalized monohalo ketone with organocuprates. Warming functionalized α-halo ketones produced under these conditions from −40 °C to room temperature leads to the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ketone.\\n(9)\\n\\nα,α'-Dihalo ketones\\nOrganocuprates may also be employed for the reduction of α,α'-dihalo ketones to alkylated ketones. In the absence of an electrophile the monoalkyl ketone is isolated in good yield; when an alkyl iodide is added, the dialkyl ketone is isolated (geminal alkylation is a problematic side reaction).\\n(10)\\nThe 2-oxyallyl metal intermediates generated during reductions of α,α'-dihalo ketones with iron(0) complexes participate in [4+3] and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions to form cycloheptenones and cyclopentanones, respectively. During [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, the substituent on the alkene may eliminate to provide cyclopentenones from alkenes in one pot.\\n(11)\\nThe scope of [4+3] cycloadditions is broad—the reaction may be used to form cycloheptenones, as well as bridged or fused polycyclic products. Reduction may be carried out in the presence of the 4π component\\n(12)\\n\\nSynthetic applications\\n[4+3] cycloadditions of pyrroles may be used to establish the bicyclic skeleton of tropane alkaloids. For instance, a synthesis of scopine uses the [4+3] cycloaddition of N-methoxycarbonylpyrrole and α,α,α',α'-tetrabromoacetone as a key step. Diastereoselective reduction with diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) followed by epoxidation with trifluoroperacetic acid affords the target.\\n(13)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOrganic reduction reactions\",\n",
       "       'Sulfonium-based oxidations of alcohols to aldehydes summarizes a group of organic reactions that transform a primary alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde (and a secondary alcohol to the corresponding ketone). Selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes requires circumventing over-oxidation to the carboxylic acid. One popular approach are methods that proceed through intermediate alkoxysulfonium species (, e.g. compound 6) as detailed here. Since most of these methods employ dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as oxidant and generate dimethylsulfide, these are often colloquially summarized as DMSO-oxidations. Conceptually, generating an aldehyde and dimethylsulfide from an alcohol and DMSO requires a dehydrating agent for removal of H2O, ideally an electrophile simultaneously activating DMSO. In contrast, methods generating the sulfonium intermediate from dimethylsulfide do not require a dehydrating agent. Closely related are oxidations mediated by dimethyl selenoxide and by dimethyl selenide.\\n\\nComparison with related methods\\nIn comparisons, sulfonium-based methods are popular because reactions are efficient (high yields, comparably fast, no over-oxidation, few side reactions, reproducible results), reaction conditions are mild (low temperature, no strong acids or bases), reactions are operationally simple (no specialized equipment or uncommon and/or costly reagents necessary, byproducts often easily separated, tolerant of oxygen and moisture,) and they generally avoid highly toxic starting materials and toxic waste disposal. However, the reactions are not too popular with many undergraduate chemistry students in the laboratory since the common byproduct dimethylsulfide is a strong odorant, reminiscent of fouling eggs, that requires a well-ventilated fume hood. Other drawbacks might include excess of base, handling of the dehydrating agent, limited choice of solvent or side reactions at elevated temperature, e.g. Pummerer rearrangement or elimination of the sulfonium intermediate to the reactive H2C=(S+)-CH3-species that form methylthiomethyl ethers with alcohols. In consequence this means that the activity of the oxidation can not be tuned at will by increasing the reaction temperature, e.g. to force oxidation of an unreactive alcohol.\\n\\nCommon alternatives to these sulfonium-based methods are oxidations with \\nhypervalent iodine (e.g., Dess-Martin, 2-Iodoxybenzoic acid)\\nchromium reagents (e.g., PCC, Collins)\\nruthenium oxides (e.g., TPAP)\\noxoammonium species (e.g., TEMPO)\\ntransfer hydrogenation or hydride transfer (e.g., Oppenauer)\\nMnO2, BaMnO4, DDQ for allylic alcohols\\n\\nCategories\\nThe sulfonium oxidations can be categorized into two groups: The methods discovered earliest rely on activated alcohols like alkyl tosylates (Kornblum) or alkyl chloroformates (from reaction of alcohols with phosgene: Barton-Kornblum) that react as electrophiles when treated with DMSO, liberating an oxygenated leaving group (e.g. ). However, the additional step for pre-activation of the alcohol and sometimes harsh reaction conditions for the nucleophilic displacement proved less convenient. Therefore, methods generating activated sulfoxides have been developed later. Depicted below is the activated sulfoxide generated during Swern oxidation 4 reacting with a secondary alcohol 5 to form alkoxysulfonium species 6.  These activated sulfoxides react as electrophiles when treated with an alcohol, expelling a leaving group that might simultaneously function as counter-ion to the alkoxysulfonium species () generated. Upon deprotonation – usually assisted by a mild base like triethylamine – the alkoxysulfonium species decomposes, yielding the aldehyde and dimethylsulfide. The latter collection contains popular oxidations like \\nSwern, \\nCorey-Kim, \\nParikh-Doering, \\n Pfitzner-Moffatt \\nand also includes Albright-Goldman, Albright-Onodera (DMSO/P2O5), TFAA/DMSO (Swern) and Me2S/Cl2.

       "       'The microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS) is an alternate pathway of ethanol metabolism that occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. While playing only a minor role in ethanol metabolism in average individuals, MEOS activity increases after chronic alcohol consumption.  The MEOS pathway requires the CYP2E1 enzyme, part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde.  Ethanol’s affinity for CYP2E1 is lower than its affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase. It has delayed activity in non-chronic alcohol consumption states as increase in MEOS activity is correlated with an increase in production of CYP2E1, seen most conclusively in alcohol dehydrogenase negative deer mice.\\n\\nThe MEOS pathway converts ethanol to acetaldehyde by way of a redox reaction. In this reaction, ethanol is oxidized (losing two hydrogens) and O2  is reduced (by accepting hydrogen) to form H2O. NADPH is used as donor of hydrogen, forming NADP+. This process consumes ATP and dissipates heat, thus leading to the hypothesis that long term drinkers see an increase in resting energy expenditure.\\n\\nThe increase in rest energy expenditure has, according to some studies, been explained by indicating that the MEOS \"expends\" nine calories per gram of ethanol to metabolize versus 7 calories per gram of ethanol ingested. This results in a net loss of 2 calories per gram of ethanol ingested.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nMetabolic pathways',\n",

       "       'Selenoxide elimination (also called α-selenation) is a method for the chemical synthesis of alkenes from selenoxides. It is most commonly used to synthesize α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the corresponding saturated analogues. It is mechanistically related to the Cope reaction.\\n\\nMechanism and stereochemistry \\nAfter the development of sulfoxide elimination as an effective method for generating carbon–carbon double bonds, it was discovered that selenoxides undergo a similar process, albeit much more rapidly. Most selenoxides decompose to the corresponding alkenes at temperatures between −50 and 40\\xa0°C. Evidence suggests that the elimination is syn; however, epimerization at both carbon and selenium (both of which are stereogenic) may occur during the reaction. As selenoxides can be readily prepared from nucleophilic carbonyl derivatives (enols and enolates), selenoxide elimination has grown into a general method for the preparation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\\n(1)\\n\\nMechanism \\nElimination of selenoxides takes place through an intramolecular syn elimination pathway. The carbon–hydrogen and carbon–selenium bonds are co-planar in the transition state.\\n(2)\\nThe reaction is highly trans-selective when acyclic α-phenylseleno carbonyl compounds are employed. Formation of conjugated double bonds is favored. Endocyclic double bonds tend to predominate over exocyclic ones, unless no syn hydrogen is available in the ring. Selenium in these reactions is almost always stereogenic, and the effect of epimerization at selenium (which is acid-catalyzed and occurs readily) on the elimination reaction is nearly unknown. In one example, separation and warming of selenoxides 1 and 2 revealed that 2 decomposes at 0\\xa0°C, while 1, which presumably has more difficulty accessing the necessary syn conformation for elimination, is stable to 5\\xa0°C.\\n(3)Kinetic isotope effect studies have found a ratio of pre-exponential factors of AH/AD of 0.092 for sulfoxide elimination reactions, indicating that quantum tunneling plays an important role in the hydrogen transfer process.\\n\\nScope and limitations\\n\\nSelanylating and oxidizing reagents\\nα-Selanylation of carbonyl compounds can be accomplished with electrophilic or nucleophilic selanylating reagents. Usually, simple phenylseleno compounds are used in elimination reactions; although 2-nitrophenylselenides react more quickly, they are more expensive to prepare, and phenylselenides typically react in minutes. Electrophilic selanylating reagents can be used in conjunction with enols, enolates, or enol ethers. Phenylselanating reagents include:\\n Diphenyl diselenide\\n Benzeneselanyl chloride\\n Benzeneselanyl bromide\\n Benzeneselinyl chloride\\n Sodium benzeneselenolate\\n Trimethylsilyl phenyl selenide\\nThe most common oxidizing agent employed is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is sometimes used in excess, to overcome catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by selenium; however, undesired oxidation of starting material has been observed under these conditions. Oxidation of products (via the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, for instance) has also been observed.\\n(4)\\nFor substrates whose product olefins are sensitive to oxidation, meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) can be employed as an oxidant. It oxidizes selenides below the temperature at which they decompose to alkenes; thus, all oxidant is consumed before elimination begins. Buffering with an amine base is necessary before warming to avoid acid-mediated side reactions.\\n(5)\\nOzone, which gives only dioxygen as a byproduct after oxidation, is used to oxidize selenides when special conditions are required for thermolysis or extreme care is necessary during workup. Quinones can be synthesized from the corresponding cyclic unsaturated carbonyl compounds using this method.\\n(6)\\n\\nSubstrates\\nα-Phenylseleno aldehydes, which are usually prepared from the corresponding enol ethers, are usually oxidized with mCPBA or ozone, as hydrogen peroxide causes over-oxidation. α-Phenylseleno ketones can be prepared by kinetically controlled enolate formation and trapping with an electrophilic selanylating reagent such as benzeneselenyl chloride. A second deprotonation, forming a selenium-substituted enolate, allows alkylation or hydroxyalkylation of these substrates.\\n(7)\\nBase-sensitive substrates may be selanylated under acid-catalyzed conditions (as enols) using benzeneselenyl chloride. Hydrochloric acid generated during the selanylation of transient enol catalyzes tautomerization.\\n(8)\\nThe seleno-Pummerer reaction is a significant side reaction that may occur under conditions when acid is present. Protonation of the selenoxide intermediate, followed by elimination of hydroxide and hydrolysis, leads to α-dicarbonyl compounds. The reaction is not a problem for more electron-rich carbonyls—generally, fewer side reactions are observed in eliminations of esters and amides.\\n(9)\\nA second significant side reaction in reactions of ketones and aldehydes is selanylation of the intermediate selenoxide. This process leads to elimination products retaining a carbon-selenium bond, and is more difficult to prevent than the seleno-Pummerer reaction. Tertiary selenoxides, which are unable to undergo enolization, do not react further with selenium electrophiles.\\n(10)\\n\\nComparison with other methods\\nAnalogous sulfoxide eliminations are generally harder to implement than selenoxide eliminations. Formation of the carbon–sulfur bond is usually accomplished with highly reactive sulfenyl chlorides, which must be prepared for immediate use. However, sulfoxides are more stable than the corresponding selenoxides, and elimination is usually carried out as a distinct operation. This allows thermolysis conditions to be optimized (although the high temperatures required may cause other thermal processes). In addition, sulfoxides may be carried through multiple synthetic steps before elimination is carried out.\\n(11)\\nThe combination of silyl enol ethers with palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2), the Saegusa oxidation, gives enones.

       "       \"Fétizon oxidation is the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols utilizing the compound silver(I) carbonate absorbed onto the surface of celite also known as Fétizon's reagent first employed by Marcel Fétizon in 1968. It is a mild reagent, suitable for both acid and base sensitive compounds. Its great reactivity with lactols makes the Fétizon oxidation a useful method to obtain lactones from a diol. The reaction is inhibited significantly by polar groups within the reaction system as well as steric hindrance of the α-hydrogen of the alcohol.\\n\\nPreparation\\nFétizon's reagent is typically prepared by adding silver nitrate to an aqueous solution of a carbonate, such as sodium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate, while being vigorously stirred in the presence of purified celite.\\n\\nMechanism\\nA proposed mechanism for the oxidation of an alcohol by Fétizon's reagent involves single electron oxidation of both the alcoholic oxygen and the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol by two atoms of silver(I) within the celite surface.  The carbonate ion then proceeds to deprotonate the resulting carbonyl generating bicarbonate which is further protonated by the additionally generated hydrogen cation to cause elimination of water and generation of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThe rate limiting step of this reaction is proposed to be the initial association of the alcohol to the silver ions.  As a result, the presence of even weakly associating ligands to the silver can inhibit the reaction greatly.  As a result, even slightly polar solvents of any variety, such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone, are avoided when using this reagent as they competitively associate with the reagent.  Additional polar functionalities of the reactant should also be avoided whenever possible as even the presence of an alkene can sometimes reduce the reactivity of a substrate 50 fold.  Commonly employed solvents such as benzene and xylene are extremely non-polar and further acceleration of the reaction can be achieved through the use of the more non-polar heptane.  The solvent is also typically refluxed to drive the reaction with heat and remove the water generated by the reaction through azeotropic distillation.\\nSteric hindrance of the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol is a major determination of the rate of oxidation as it effects the rate of association. Tertiary alcohols lacking an alpha hydrogen are selected against and generally do not oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent.\\n\\nIncreasing the amount of celite used in the reagent accelerates the rate of the reaction by increasing the surface area available to react.  However, increasing the amount of celite past 900 grams per mole of silver(I) carbonate begins to slow the reaction due to dilution effects.\\n\\nReactivity\\nFétizon's reagent is used primarily in the oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones with a slight selectivity toward secondary alcohols and unsaturated alcohols.  The reaction is typically done in a refluxing dry non-polar organic solvent with copious stirring.  The reaction time varies with the structure of the alcohol and is typically completed within three hours.  A very attractive property of Fétizon's reagent is its ability to be separated from the reaction product by physically filtering it out and washing with benzene.  \\nThe inability of Fétizon's reagent to oxidize tertiary alcohols makes it extremely useful in the monooxidation of a [1,2] diol in which one of the alcohols is tertiary while avoiding cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond.\\n \\n\\nThe mildness and structural sensitivity of the reagent also makes this reagent ideal for the monooxidation of a symmetric diol.\\n\\nLactols are extremely sensitive to Fétizon's reagent, being oxidized very quickly to a lactone functionality.  This allows for the selective oxidation of lactols in the presence of other alcohols.  This also allows for a classic use of Fétizon's reagent to form lactones from a primary diol.  By oxidizing one of the alcohols to an aldehyde, the second alcohol equilibrates with the aldehyde to form a lactol which is reacted quickly with more Fétizon's reagent to trap the cyclic intermediate as a lactone. This method allows for the synthesis of seven-member lactones which are traditionally more challenging to synthesize.\\n\\nPhenol functional groups can be oxidized to their respective quinone forms.  These quinones can further couple within solution producing numerous dimerizations depending upon their substituents. \\n\\nAmines have been shown to oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent to enamines and iminium cations that have been trapped, but can also be selected against in a compound with more easily oxidized alcohol functionalities.\\nFétizon's reagent can also being used to facilitate cycloaddition of a 4-hydroxy-2-furoquinilone and an olefin to form dihydrofuroquinolinones.\\n\\nProtecting groups\\nPara-methoxybenzyl (PMB) is a commonly used protecting group for alcohols against Fétizon's reagent.  As Fétizon's oxidation is a neutral reaction, acid and base sensitive protecting groups are also compatible with the reagent and by products generated.\\n\\nSensitive groups\\nWhile tertiary alcohols are typically not affected by Fétizon's reagent, tertiary propargylic alcohols have been shown to oxidize under these conditions and results in the fragmentation of the alcohol with an alkyne leaving group.\\n\\nHalohydrins that possess a trans stereochemistry have been demonstrated to form epoxides and transposed products in the presence of Fétizon's reagent.  Halohydrins possessing a cis-stereochemistry seem to perform a typical Fétizon's oxidation to a ketone.\\n\\n[1,3] diols have a tendency to eliminate water following the monooxidation by Fétizon's reagent to form an enone.\\n\\nUnder differing structural conditions, [1,2] diols can form diketones in the presence of Fétizon's reagent.  However, oxidative carbon-carbon bond cleavage may also occur.\\n\\nApplications\\nSince its discovery as a useful method of oxidation, Fétizon's reagent has been used in the total synthesis of numerous molecules such as (±)-bukittinggine. \\nFétizon's reagent has also been employed extensively in the study of various sugar chemistry, to achieve selective oxidation of tri and tetra methylated aldoses to aldolactones, oxidation of D-xylose and L-arabinose to D-threose and L-erythrose respectively, and oxidation of L-sorbose to afford L-threose among many others.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nName reactions\\nOrganic oxidation reactions\",\n",

Today, selenium-dioxide-mediated oxidation of methylene groups to alpha ketones and at the allylic position of olefins is known as the Riley Oxidation.\\n\\nMechanism \\nThe mechanism of oxidation of -CH2C(O)R group by SeO2 has been well investigated.  The oxidation of carbonyl alpha methylene positions begins with attack by the enol tautomer at the electrophilic selenium center.  Following rearrangement and loss of water, a second equivalent of water attacks the alpha position.  Selenic acid is liberated in the final step to give the 1,2-dicarbonyl product.  \\n\\nAllylic oxidation using selenium-dioxide proceeds via an ene reaction at the electrophilic selenium center.  A 2,3-sigmatropic shift, proceeding through an envelope-like transition state, gives the allylselenite ester, which upon hydrolysis gives the allylic alcohol.  The (E)- orientation about the double bond, a consequence of the envelope-like transition state, is observed in the penultimate ester formation, is retained during the hydrolysis step giving the (E)-allylic alcohol product.\\n\\nScope\\nThe Riley Oxidation is amenable to a variety of carbonyl and olefinic systems with a high degree of regiocontrol based on the substitution pattern of the given system.\\n\\nKetones with two available alpha methylene positions react more quickly at the least hindered position.: \\n\\nAllylic oxidation can be predicted by the substitution pattern on the olefin.  In the case of 1,2-disubstituted olefins, reaction rates follow CH > CH¬2 > CH3:\\n\\nGeminally-substiuted olefins react in the same order of reaction rates as above:\\n\\nTrisubstiuted alkenes experience reactivity at the more substituted end of the double bond.  The order of reactivity follows that CH2 > CH¬3 > CH:\\n\\nDue to the rearrangement of the double bond, terminal olefins tend to give primary allylic alcohols:\\n\\nCyclic alkenes prefer to undergo allylic oxidation within the ring, rather than the allylic position at the sidechain.  In bridged ring systems, Bredt’s rule is followed and bridgehead positions are not oxidized:\\n\\nApplications\\nIn their landmark synthesis of strychnine, R.B. Woodward and co-workers leveraged the Riley Oxidation to attain the trans-glyoxal. Epimerization of the alpha hydrogen led to cis-glyoxal, which spontaneously underwent cyclization with the secondary amine to yield dehydrostryninone.\\n\\nSelenium-dioxide mediated oxidation was used in the synthesis of the diterpenoid ryanodol.\\n\\nSelenium dioxide mediated allylic oxidation to access ingenol.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nOrganic oxidation reactions\\nName reactions',\n",
       "       'Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (also called the Sharpless bishydroxylation) is the chemical reaction of an alkene with osmium tetroxide in the presence of a chiral quinine ligand to form a vicinal diol. The reaction has been applied to alkenes of virtually every substitution, often high enantioselectivities are realized. Asymmetric dihydroxylation reactions are also highly site selective, providing products derived from reaction of the most electron-rich double bond in the substrate.\\n\\nIt is common practice to perform this reaction using a catalytic amount of osmium tetroxide, which after reaction is regenerated with reoxidants such as potassium ferricyanide or N-methylmorpholine N-oxide. This dramatically reduces the amount of the highly toxic and very expensive osmium tetroxide needed. These four reagents are commercially available premixed (\"AD-mix\"). The mixture containing (DHQ)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-α, and the mixture containing (DHQD)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-β.\\n\\nSuch chiral diols are important in organic synthesis. The introduction of chirality into nonchiral reactants through usage of chiral catalysts is an important concept in organic synthesis.  This reaction was developed principally by K. Barry Sharpless building on the already known racemic Upjohn dihydroxylation, for which he was awarded a share of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\\n\\nBackground \\nAlkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins. However, since osmium(VIII) reagents like osmium tetroxide (OsO4) are expensive and extremely toxic, it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction. Some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide (Milas hydroxylation), N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO, Upjohn dihydroxylation), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP), and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). K. Barry Sharpless was the first to develop a general, reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation, referred to as the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (SAD). Low levels of OsO4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant.\\n\\nReaction mechanism \\nThe reaction mechanism of the Sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex (2).  A [3+2]-cycloaddition with the alkene (3) gives the cyclic intermediate 4.  Basic hydrolysis liberates the diol (5) and the reduced osmate (6).  Methanesulfonamide (CH3SO2NH2) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 °C.  Finally, the stoichiometric oxidant regenerates the osmium tetroxide – ligand complex (2).\\n\\nThe mechanism of the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified (see below). If the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates, then an osmium(VIII)-diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene. Dihydroxylations resulting from this secondary pathway generally suffer lower enantioselectivities than those resulting from the primary pathway. A schematic showing this secondary catalytic pathway is shown below. This secondary pathway may be suppressed by using a higher molar concentration of ligand.\\n\\n[2+2] vs [3+2] debate\\nIn his original report Sharpless suggested the reaction proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 onto the alkene to give an osmaoxetane intermediate (see below). This intermediate would then undergo a 1,1- migratory insertion to form an osmylate ester which after hydrolysis would give the corresponding diol. In 1989 E. J. Corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a [3+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester. Corey\\'s suggestion was based on a previous computational study done by Jorgensen and Hoffmann which determined the [3+2] reaction pathway to be the lower energy pathway. In addition Corey reasoned that steric repulsions in the octahedral intermediate would disfavor the [2+2] pathway.\\n\\nThe next ten years saw numerous publications by both Corey and Sharpless, each supporting their own version of the mechanism. While these studies were not able to distinguish between the two proposed cyclization pathways, they were successful in shedding light on the mechanism in other ways. For example, Sharpless provided evidence for the reaction proceeding via a step-wise mechanism. Additionally both Sharpless and Corey showed that the active catalyst possesses a U-shaped chiral binding pocket. Corey also showed that the catalyst obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and acts like an enzyme pocket with a pre-equilibrium. In the February 1997 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society Sharpless published the results of a study (a Hammett analysis) which he claimed supported a [2+2] cyclization over a [3+2]. In the October issue of the same year, however, Sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with Ken Houk and Singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the [3+2] mechanism. Thus Sharpless was forced to concede the decade-long debate.\\n\\nCatalyst structure \\n\\nCrystallographic evidence has shown that the active catalyst possesses a pentacoordinate osmium species held in a U-shaped binding pocket. The nitrogenous ligand holds OsO4 in a chiral environment making approach of one side of the olefin sterically hindered while the other is not.\\n\\nCatalytic Systems \\nNumerous catalytic systems and modifications have been developed for the SAD. Given below is a brief overview of the various components of the catalytic system:\\n Catalytic Oxidant: This is always OsO4, however certain additives can coordinate to the osmium(VIII) and modify its electronic properties. OsO4 is often generated in situ from K2OsO2(OH)4 (an Os(VI) species) due to safety concerns.\\n Chiral Auxiliary: This is usually some kind of cinchona alkaloid.\\n Stoichiometric Oxidant:\\n Peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle; see the Milas hydroxylation. Drawbacks of peroxides include chemoselectivity issues.\\n Trialkylammonium N-oxides, such as NMO—as in the Upjohn Reaction—and trimethylamine N-oxide.\\n Potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction, and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available AD-mix preparations.\\n Additive:\\n Citric acid: Osmium tetroxide is an electrophilic oxidant and as such reacts slowly with electron-deficient olefins. It has been found that the rate of oxidation of electron-deficient olefins can be accelerated by maintaining the pH of the reaction slightly acidic. On the other hand, a high pH can increase the rate of oxidation of internal olefins, and also increase the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the oxidation of terminal olefins.\\n\\nRegioselectivity \\nIn general Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation favors oxidation of the more electron-rich alkene (scheme 1).\\n\\nIn this example SAD gives the diol of the alkene closest to the (electron-withdrawing) para-methoxybenzoyl group, albeit in low yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aryl ring to interact favorably with the active site of the catalyst via π-stacking. In this manner the aryl substituent can act as a directing group.\\n\\nStereoselectivity \\nThe diastereoselectivity of SAD is set primarily by the choice of ligand (i.e. AD-mix-α versus AD-mix-β), however factors such as pre-existing chirality in the substrate or neighboring functional groups may also play a role. In the example shown below, the para-methoxybenzoyl substituent serves primarily as a source of steric bulk to allow the catalyst to differentiate the two faces of the alkene.\\n\\nIt is often difficult to obtain high diastereoselectivity on cis-alkenes when both sides of the olefin have similar steric environments.\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nSee also \\n Asymmetric catalytic oxidation\\n Milas hydroxylation\\n Upjohn dihydroxylation\\n Sharpless aminohydroxylation\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nOrganic redox reactions\\nName reactions'],\n",

       "array(['In probability theory, an outcome is a possible result of an experiment or trial. Each possible outcome of a particular experiment is unique, and different outcomes are mutually exclusive (only one outcome will occur on each trial of the experiment). All of the possible outcomes of an experiment form the elements of a sample space.\\n\\nFor the experiment where we flip a coin twice, the four possible outcomes that make up our sample space are (H, T), (T, H), (T, T) and (H, H), where \"H\" represents a \"heads\", and \"T\" represents a \"tails\". Outcomes should not be confused with events, which are  (or informally, \"groups\") of outcomes. For comparison, we could define an event to occur when \"at least one \\'heads\\'\" is flipped in the experiment - that is, when the outcome contains at least one \\'heads\\'. This event would contain all outcomes in the sample space except the element (T, T).\\n\\nSets of outcomes: events\\n\\nSince individual outcomes may be of little practical interest, or because there may be prohibitively (even infinitely) many of them, outcomes are grouped into sets of outcomes that satisfy some condition, which are called \"events.\" The collection of all such events is a sigma-algebra.\\n\\nAn event containing exactly one outcome is called an elementary event. The event that contains all possible outcomes of an experiment is its sample space. A single outcome can be a part of many different events.\\n\\nTypically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event (that is, all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite (most notably when the outcome must be some real number). So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events.\\n\\nProbability of an outcome\\nOutcomes may occur with probabilities that are between zero and one (inclusively). In a discrete probability distribution whose sample space is finite, each outcome is assigned a particular probability. In contrast, in a continuous distribution, individual outcomes all have zero probability, and non-zero probabilities can only be assigned to ranges of outcomes.\\n\\nSome \"mixed\" distributions contain both stretches of continuous outcomes and some discrete outcomes; the discrete outcomes in such distributions can be called atoms and can have non-zero probabilities.\\n\\nUnder the measure-theoretic definition of a probability space, the probability of an outcome need not even be defined. In particular, the set of events on which probability is defined may be some σ-algebra on  and not necessarily the full power set.\\n\\nEqually likely outcomes\\n\\nIn some sample spaces, it is reasonable to estimate or assume that all outcomes in the space are equally likely (that they occur with equal probability). For example, when tossing an ordinary coin, one typically assumes that the outcomes \"head\" and \"tail\" are equally likely to occur. An implicit assumption that all outcomes are equally likely underpins most randomization tools used in common games of chance (e.g. rolling dice, shuffling cards, spinning tops or wheels, drawing lots, etc.). Of course, players in such games can try to cheat by subtly introducing systematic deviations from equal likelihood (for example, with marked cards, loaded or shaved dice, and other methods).\\n\\nSome treatment of probability assume that the various outcomes of an experiment are always defined so as to be equally likely. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a set of equally likely outcomes— for example, if one were to toss a thumb tack many times and observe whether it landed with its point upward or downward, there is no symmetry to suggest that the two outcomes should be equally likely.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nExperiment (probability theory)',\n",

       "       \"The Probabilistic Serial rule (PS), also called serial eating algorithm, is a rule for fair random assignment. It yields a randomized allocation of indivisible items among several agents that is ex-ante envy-free and Pareto efficient. It was developed by Hervé Moulin and Anna Bogomolnaia.\\n\\nDescription \\nEach item is represented as a loaf of bread (or other food). Initially, each agent goes to their favourite item and starts eating it. It is possible that several agents eat the same item at the same time.\\n\\nWhenever an item is fully eaten, each of the agents who ate it goes to their favorite remaining item and starts eating it in the same way, until all items are consumed.\\n\\nFor each item, the fraction of that item eaten by each agent is recorded. These fractions are considered as probabilities. Based on these probabilities, a lottery is done. The type of lottery depends on the problem:\\n\\n If each agent is allowed to receive any number of items, then a separate lottery can be done for each item. Each item is given to one of the agents who ate a part of it, chosen at random according to the probability distribution for that item.\\n If each agent should receive exactly one item, then there must be a single lottery that picks an assignment by some probability distribution on the set of deterministic assignments. To do this, the n-by-n matrix of probabilities should be decomposed into a convex combination of permutation matrices. This can be done by the Birkhoff algorithm. It is guaranteed to find a combination in which the number of permutation matrices is at most n2-2n+2.\\n\\nAn important parameter to PS is the eating speed of each agent. In the simplest case, when all agents have the same entitlements, it makes sense to let all agents eat in the same speed all the time. However, when agents have different entitlements, it is possible to give the more privileged agents a higher eating speed. Moreover, it is possible to let the eating speed change with time.\\n\\nExamples \\nThere are four agents and four items (denoted w,x,y,z). The preferences of the agents are:\\n Alice and Bob prefer w to x to y to z.\\n Chana and Dana prefer x to w to z to y.\\n\\nThe agents have equal rights so we apply PS with equal and uniform eating speed of 1 unit per minute.\\n\\nInitially, Alice and Bob go to w and Chana and Dana go to x. Each pair eats their item simultaneously. After 1/2 minute, Alice and Bob each have 1/2 of w, while Chana and Dana each have 1/2 of x.\\n\\nThen, Alice and Bob go to y (their favourite remaining item) and Chana and Dana go to z (their favourite remaining item). After 1/2 minute, Alice and Bob each have 1/2 of y and Chana and Dana each have 1/2 of z.\\n\\nThe matrix of probabilities is now:Alice:     1/2 0 1/2 0\\n\\nBob:      1/2 0 1/2 0\\n\\nChana:   0 1/2 0 1/2\\n\\nDana:     0 1/2 0 1/2Based on the eaten fractions, item w is given to either Alice or Bob with equal probability and the same is done with item y; item x is given to either Chana or Dana with equal probability and the same is done with item z. If it is required to give exactly 1 item per agent, then the matrix of probabilities is decomposed into the following two assignment matrices:1 0 0 0     |||     0 0 1 0\\n\\n0 0 1 0     |||     1 0 0 0\\n\\n0 1 0 0     |||     0 0 0 1\\n\\n0 0 0 1     |||     0 1 0 0One of these assignments is selected at random with a probability of 1/2.\\n\\nOther examples can be generated at the MatchU.ai website.\\n\\nProperties \\nPS rule several desirable properties. The description below assumes that all agents have risk-neutral preferences, that is, their utility from a lottery equals the expected value of their utility from the outcomes.\\n\\nFairness \\nPS satisfies a fairness property called ex-ante stochastic-dominace envy-freeness (sd-envy-free). Informally it means that each agent, considering the resulting probability matrix, weakly prefers his/her own row of probabilities to the row of any other agent. Formally, for every two agents i and j:\\n\\n Agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get his best item in row i than in row j; \\n Agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get one of his two best items in row i than in row j; \\n ... \\n For any k ≥ 1, agent i has a weakly-higher probability to get one of his k best items in row i than in row j.\\n\\nNote that sd-envy-freeness is guaranteed ex-ante: it is fair only before the lottery takes place. The algorithm is of course not ex-post fair: after the lottery takes place, the unlucky agents may envy the lucky ones. This is inevitable in allocation of indivisible objects.\\n\\nEfficiency \\nPS satisfies an efficiency property called ex-ante stochastic-dominace Pareto efficiency (sd-efficiency, also called: ordinal efficiency). Informally it means that, considering the resulting probability matrix, there is no other matrix that all agents weakly-sd-prefer and at least one agent strictly-sd-prefers.\\n\\nHere, the ex-ante notion of sd-efficiency is stronger than the ex-post notion: sd-efficiency implies that every allocation selected by the lottery is sd-Pareto-efficient.\\n\\nStrategy \\nPS is not a truthful mechanism: an agent who knows that his most preferred item is not wanted by any other agent, can manipulate the algorithm by eating his second-most preferred item, knowing that his best item will remain intact. The following is known about strategic manipulation of PS:\\n\\n An agent can compute in polynomial time a best-response w.r.t. the downward lexicographic relation. When there are two agents, each agent can compute in polynomial time a best response w.r.t. expected utility. When the number of agents can vary, computing a best response w.r.t. EU is NP-hard.\\nBest responses w.r.t. expected utility can cycle. However, a pure Nash equilibrium exists for any number of agents and houses. When there are two agents, there are linear-time algorithms to compute a preference-profile that is in Nash equilibrium w.r.t. the original preferences. In some empirical settings, PS is less prone to manipulation. When an agent is risk-averse and has no information about the other agents' strategies, his maximin strategy is to be truthful.\\nNote that the random priority rule, which solves the same problem as PS, is truthful.\\n\\nExtensions \\nBudish, Che, Kojima and Milgrom extend PS to multi-unit settings, where there are more objects than agents, each agent can get several units, and there are some constraints on the feasible allocations.\\n\\nGuaranteeing ex-post approximate fairness \\nAs explained above, the allocation determined by PS is fair only ex-ante but not ex-post. Moreover, when each agent may get any number of items, the ex-post unfairness might be arbitrarily bad: theoretically it is possible that one agent will get all the items while other agents get none. Recently, several algorithms have been suggested, that guarantee both ex-ante fairness and ex-post approximate-fairness.\\n\\nFreeman, Shah and Vaish show:\\n\\n The Recursive Probabilistic Serial (RecPS) algorithm, which returns a probability distribution over allocations that are all envy-free-except-one-item (EF1). The distribution is ex-ante EF, and the allocation is ex-post EF1. A naive version of this algorithm yields a distribution over a possibly exponential number of deterministic allocations, a support size polynomial in the number of agents and goods is sufficient, and thus the algorithm runs in polynomial time. The algorithm uses separation oracles.  \\n A different algorithm, based on an ex-ante max-product allocation, which attains ex-ante group envy-freeness (GEF; it implies both EF and PO), and ex-post PROP1+EF11. This is the only allocation rule that achieves all these properties. It cannot be decomposed into EF1 allocations.\\nThese combinations of properties are best possible: it is impossible to guarantee simultaneously ex-ante EF (even PROP) and ex-ante PO together with ex-post EF1; or ex-ante EF (even PROP) together with ex-post EF1 and fractional-PO. \\n The RecPS can be modified to attain similar guarantees (ex-ante EF and ex-post EF1) for bads.\\n\\nAziz shows:\\n\\n The PS-lottery algorithm, in which the allocation is ex-ante sd-EF, and the lottery is done only among deterministic allocations that are sd-EF1, i.e., the EF and EF1 guarantees hold for any cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal ranking. Moreover, the outcome is sd-PO both ex-ante and ex-post. The algorithm uses as subroutines both the PS algorithm and the Birkhoff algorithm. The ex-ante allocation is equivalent to the one returned by PS; this shows that the outcome of PS can be decomposed into EF1 allocations. \\nWith binary utilities, the PS-lottery algorithm is group-strategyproof, ex-ante PO, ex-ante EF and ex-post EF1.\\nThese combinations of properties are best possible: it is impossible to guarantee simultaneously ex-ante sd-EF, ex-post EF1 and ex-post PO; or ex-ante PO and ex-ante sd-EF.\\n Checking whether a given random allocation can be implemented by a lottery over EF1 and PO allocations is NP-hard.\\n\\nBabaioff, Ezra and Feige show:\\n\\n A polynomial-time algorithm for computing allocations that are ex-ante proportional, and ex-post both PROP1 and 1/2-fraction maximin-share (and also 1/2-fraction truncated-proportional share).\\n These properties are nearly optimal - it is impossible to guarantee more than PROP ex-ante, and more than n/(2n-1) truncated-proportional share ex-post.\\n\\nSee also \\nThe page on fair random assignment compares PS to other procedures for solving the same problem, such as the random priority rule.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nFair division protocols\",\n",
       "       'The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law is a theorem in probability theory, similar to Kolmogorov\\'s zero–one law and the Borel–Cantelli lemma, that specifies that a certain type of event will either almost surely happen or almost surely not happen. It is sometimes known as the Savage-Hewitt law for symmetric events. It is named after Edwin Hewitt and Leonard Jimmie Savage.\\n\\nStatement of the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law\\nLet  be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables taking values in a set .  The Hewitt-Savage zero–one law says that any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence is determined by the values of these random variables and whose occurrence or non-occurrence is unchanged by finite permutations of the indices, has probability either 0 or 1 (a \"finite\" permutation is one that leaves all but finitely many of the indices fixed).\\n\\nSomewhat more abstractly, define the exchangeable sigma algebra or sigma algebra of symmetric events  to be the set of events (depending on the sequence of variables ) which are invariant under finite permutations of the indices in the sequence . Then .\\n\\nSince any finite permutation can be written as a product of transpositions, if we wish to check whether or not an event  is symmetric (lies in ), it is enough to check if its occurrence is unchanged by an arbitrary transposition , .\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nExample 1\\nLet the sequence  take values in . Then the event that the series  converges (to a finite value) is a symmetric event in , since its occurrence is unchanged under transpositions (for a finite re-ordering, the convergence or divergence of the series—and, indeed, the numerical value of the sum itself—is independent of the order in which we add up the terms). Thus, the series either converges almost surely or diverges almost surely. If we assume in addition that the common expected value  (which essentially means that  because of the random variables\\' non-negativity), we may conclude that\\n\\ni.e. the series diverges almost surely. This is a particularly simple application of the Hewitt–Savage zero–one law. In many situations, it can be easy to apply the Hewitt–Savage zero–one law to show that some event has probability 0 or 1, but surprisingly hard to determine which of these two extreme values is the correct one.\\n\\nExample 2\\nContinuing with the previous example, define\\n\\n \\n\\nwhich is the position at step N of a random walk with the iid increments Xn. The event {\\xa0SN\\xa0=\\xa00\\xa0infinitely\\xa0often\\xa0} is invariant under finite permutations.

It is reasonable to assume that the number of raindrops that fall in any particular region of the rooftop follows a poisson distribution.  The Poisson Scatter Theorem, states that if one was to subdivide the rooftops into k disjoint sub-regions, then the number of raindrops that hits a particular region  with intensity  of the rooftop is independent from the number of raindrops that hit any other subregion. Suppose that 2000 raindrops fall in 1000 subregions of the rooftop, randomly. The expected number of raindrops per subregion would be\\xa02.

The distribution of the number of raindrops falling on 1/5 of the rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter\\xa02/5. \\n\\nDue to the reproductive property of the Poisson distribution, k independent random scatters on the same region can superimpose to produce a random scatter that follows a poisson distribution with parameter .\\n\\nNotes \\n^ Pitman 2003, p. 230.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nPitman, Jim (2003).

       "       'A super-proportional division is a kind of a fair division. It is a division of resources among n partners, in which the value received by each partner is strictly more than his/her due share of 1/n of the total value. Formally, in a super-proportional division of a resource C among n partners, each partner i, with value measure Vi, receives a share Xi such that.Obviously, a super-proportional division does not exist when all partners have the same value measure. The best condition that can always be guaranteed is , which is the condition for a plain proportional division. However, one may hope that, when different agents have different valuations, it may be possible to use this fact for the benefit of all players, and give each of them strictly more than their due share.\\n\\nExistence \\nIn 1948, Hugo Steinhaus conjectured the existence of a super-proportional division of a cake:It may be stated incidentally that if there are two (or more) partners with different estimations, there exists a division giving to everybody more than his due part (Knaster); this fact disproves the common opinion that differences estimations make fair division difficult.In 1961, Dubins and Spanier proved that the necessary condition for existence is also sufficient. That is, whenever the partners\\' valuations are additive and non-atomic, and there are at least two partners whose value function is even slightly different, then there is a super-proportional division in which all partners receive more than 1/n.\\n\\nThe proof was a corollary to the Dubins–Spanier convexity theorem. This was a purely existential proof based on convexity arguments.\\n\\nProtocol \\nIn 1986, Douglas R. Woodall published a protocol for finding a super-proportional division.\\n\\nSingle piece of disagreement \\nLet C be the entire cake. The protocol starts with a specific piece of cake, say X ⊆ C, which is valued differently by two partners. Call these partners Alice and Bob.\\n\\nLet a=VAlice(X) and b=VBob(X) and assume w.l.o.g. that b>a.\\n\\nTwo pieces of disagreement \\nFind a rational number between b and a, say p/q such that b > p/q > a. Ask Bob to divide X to p equal parts and divide C \\\\ X to q-p equal parts. \\n\\nBy our assumptions, Bob values each piece of X as more than 1/q and each piece of C \\\\ X as less than 1/q. But for Alice, at least one piece of X (say, Y) must have a value of less than 1/q and at least one piece of C\\\\X (say, Z) must have a value of more than 1/q. \\n\\nSo now we have two pieces, Y and Z, such that:\\nVBob(Y)>VBob(Z)\\nVAlice(Y)<VAlice(Z)\\n\\nSuper-proportional division for two partners \\nLet Alice and Bob divide the remainder C \\\\ Y \\\\ Z between them in a proportional manner (e.g. using divide and choose). Add Z to the piece of Alice and add Y to the piece of Bob.\\n\\nNow each partner thinks that his/her allocation is strictly better than the other allocation, so its value is strictly more than 1/2.\\n\\nSuper-proportional division for n partners \\nThe extension of this protocol to n partners is based on Fink\\'s \"Lone Chooser\" protocol. \\n\\nSuppose we already have a super-proportional division to i-1 partners (for i≥3). Now partner #i enters the party and we should give him a small piece from each of the first i-1 partners, such that the new division is still super-proportional.\\n\\nConsider e.g. partner #1. Let d be the difference between partner #1\\'s current value and (1/(i-1)). Because the current division is super-proportional, we know that d>0.\\n\\nChoose a positive integer q such that: \\n\\nAsk partner #1 to divide his share to  pieces which he considers of equal value and let the new partner choose the  pieces which he considers to be the most valuable. \\n\\nPartner #1 remains with a value of  of his previous value, which was  (by definition of d). The first element becomes  and the d becomes ; summing them up gives that the new value is more than:  of the entire cake.\\n\\nAs for the new partner, after having taken q pieces from each of the first i-1 partners, his total value is at least:  of the entire cake.\\n\\nThis proves that the new division is also super-proportional.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nFair division protocols\\n\\nCake-cutting',\n",

       "       'Single-peaked preferences are a class of preference relations. A group of agents is said to have single-peaked preferences over a set of possible outcomes if the outcomes can be ordered along a line such that: \\n Each agent has a \"best outcome\" in the set, and -\\n For each agent, outcomes that are further from his or her best outcome are preferred less.\\n\\nSingle-peaked preferences are typical of one-dimensional domains. A typical example is when several consumers have to decide on the amount of public good to purchase. The amount is a one-dimensional variable. Usually, each consumer decides on a certain quantity which is best for him or her, and if the actual quantity is more/less than that ideal quantity,  the agent is then less satisfied.\\n\\nWith single-peaked preferences, there is a simple truthful mechanism for selecting an outcome: it is to select the median quantity. See the median voter theorem. It is truthful because the median function satisfies the strong monotonicity property.\\n\\nThe notion was first presented by Duncan Black and later by Kenneth Arrow.\\n\\nDefinitions \\nLet   be the set of possible outcomes. Let  be the set of agents. The preference-relation of agent i is denoted by . The maximum element of  in X is denoted by .\\n\\nDefinition using a common order \\nThe group N is said to have single-peaked preferences over X, if there exists an ordering > of the outcomes such that, for every agent i in N:In words,  is the ideal point for agent i. When the agent compares between two outcomes that are both to the right or to the left of his ideal point, he strictly prefers whichever option is closest to  .\\n\\nNote that the preference-relations  are different, but the ordering > of the outcomes must be the same for all agents.\\n\\nNecessary condition \\nBallester and Haeringer proved the following necessary condition for single-peaked preferences.\\n\\nIf the group N has single-peaked preferences over X, then for every triplet of outcomes in X, there exists an outcome that is not ranked last by any agent in N.\\n\\nSome examples\\n\\nSingle-peaked preferences \\nThe following graph shows a set of three preferences that are single-peaked over outcomes {A,B,C,D,E}. On the vertical axis, the number represents the preference ranking of the outcome, with 1 being most preferred. Two outcomes that are equally preferred have the same ranking.\\n\\nThe ordering over the outcomes is A < B < C < D < E. The ideal outcome for the green agent is A, for the red it is B, for the blue it is C. For each agent, when we move away from his ideal outcome, the ranking decreases.\\n\\nIt can also be verified that, for each triplet of outcomes, one of them is never ranked last - the one in the middle. E.g., in {A,B,C}, B is never ranked last; in {C,D,E}, D is never ranked last; etc.\\n\\nNon single-peaked preferences \\nIf each of the two preferences represented by the following two graphs is added to the three preferences above, then the resulting group of four preferences is not single-peaked:\\n\\nFor the blue preferences, it can be seen that the preference ranking spikes down for \"D\" and then spikes up for \"E\". This proves that the blue preferences are not single-peaked with respect to the ordering A<B<C<D<E, but it still does not prove that there is no other ordering with which all four preferences are single-peaked. To formally prove this, consider the set of three outcomes {A, D, E}. Each of these outcomes is a worst outcome of some agent: A is worst for the red agent, D is worst for the blue agent, and E is worst for the green agent above. Therefore, no ordering on X can make the set of preferences single-peaked. \\n\\nThe green preferences are not formally single-peaked because they have two outcomes that are the most preferred: \"B\" and \"C\". Such preferences are sometimes called single-plateaued.\\n\\nInterpretations \\n\\nSingle-peaked preferences have a number of interpretations for different applications.\\n\\nA simple application of ideological preferences is to think of the outcome space  as locations on a street and each  as the address of an individual. Suppose a single bus stop has to be located on the street and every individual wishes to walk as little as possible to the stop. Individuals then have single-peaked preferences: individual \\'s ideal point is  and she dislikes other locations the farther they are to the west or the farther they are to the east.\\n\\nThe outcome space can also be thought as different policies in an ideological spectrum: policies from the Left vs policies from the Right; policies that are more liberal vs policies that are more conservative; policies that are pro free markets vs policies that are pro state intervention. Voters have single-peaked preferences if they have an ideal balance between the two directions of the ideological spectrum and if they dislike policies the farther away they are from their ideal point.\\n\\nSingle-dipped preferences \\nA group of agents is said to have single-dipped preferences over a set of possible outcomes if the outcomes can be ordered along a line such that:\\n Each agent has a \"worst outcome\" in the set, and -\\n For each agent, outcomes that are further from his worst outcome are preferred more.\\n\\nSee also \\n Single-parameter mechanism\\n\\nReferences \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nElections\\nUtility function types',\n",

Among various theories, Bayesian DM is broadly accepted axiomatically based theory that solves the design of optimal decision strategy.

       "       'In the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number) or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.\\n\\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, one for each method of encoding programs, it is common to use the letter Ω to refer to them as if there were only one.  Because Ω depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin\\'s construction when not referring to any specific encoding.\\n\\nEach halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Each halting probability is Martin-Löf random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\\n\\nBackground \\nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function.  Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\\n\\nSuppose that F is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function F is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary strings x and y,  F(x) = y if and only if the Turing machine halts with y on its tape when given the input x).\\n\\nThe function F is called universal if the following property holds:  for every computable function f of a single variable there is a string w such that for all x, F(w\\xa0x) = f(x); here w\\xa0x represents the concatenation of the two strings w and x.  This means that F can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable.  Informally, w represents a \"script\" for the computable function f, and F represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\\n\\nThe domain of F is the set of all inputs p on which it is defined. For F that are universal, such a p can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function F.\\n\\nThe function F is called prefix-free if there are no two elements p, p′ in its domain such that p′ is a proper extension of p. This can be rephrased as: the domain of F is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits, and the remaining bits are not considered part of the accepted string. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\\n\\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set.  The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.\\n\\nDefinition \\nLet PF be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function F.  The constant ΩF is then defined as\\n,\\nwhere  denotes the length of a string p. This is an infinite sum which has one summand for every p in the domain of F.  The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft\\'s inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1.  If F is clear from context then ΩF may be denoted simply Ω, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of Ω.\\n\\nRelationship to the halting problem \\nKnowing the first N bits of Ω, one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to N. Let the program p for which the halting problem is to be solved be N bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first N bits. If the program p hasn\\'t halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first N bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for p.\\n\\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach\\'s conjecture, are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin\\'s constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin\\'s constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.\\n\\nInterpretation as a probability \\nThe Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space.  It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\\n\\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string x the set of sequences that begin with x has measure 2−|x|. This implies that for each natural number n, the set of sequences f in Cantor space such that f(n) = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose nth element is 0 also has measure 1/2.\\n\\nLet F be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain P of F consists of an infinite set of binary strings\\n.\\nEach of these strings pi determines a subset Si of Cantor space; the set Si contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with pi. These sets are disjoint because P is a prefix-free set.  The sum\\n\\nrepresents the measure of the set \\n.\\n\\nIn this way, ΩF represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of F. It is for this reason that ΩF is called a halting probability.\\n\\nProperties \\nEach Chaitin constant Ω has the following properties:\\n\\n It is algorithmically random (also known as Martin-Löf random or 1-random). This means that the shortest program to output the first n bits of Ω must be of size at least n-O(1). This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those n bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most n.\\n As a consequence, it is a normal number, which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.\\n It is not a computable number; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below.\\n The set of rational numbers q such that q < Ω is computably enumerable; a real number with such a property is called a left-c.e. real number in recursion theory.\\n The set of rational numbers q such that q > Ω is not computably enumerable. (Reason: every left-c.e. real with this property is computable, which Ω isn\\'t.)\\n Ω is an arithmetical number.\\n It is Turing equivalent to the halting problem and thus at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.\\n\\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability.  A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals. One can show that a real number in [0,1] is a Chaitin constant (i.e. the halting probability of some prefix-free universal computable function) if and only if it is left-c.e. and algorithmically random. Ω is among the few definable algorithmically random numbers and is the best-known algorithmically random number, but it is not at all typical of all algorithmically random numbers.\\n\\nUncomputability \\nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given n, returns the first n digits of the number.  This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\\n\\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first n digits of Ω, solves Turing\\'s halting problem for programs of length up to n. Since the halting problem is undecidable, Ω cannot be computed.\\n\\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows.  Given the first n digits of Ω and a k ≤ n, the algorithm enumerates the domain of F until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2−(k+1) of Ω. After this point, no additional program of length k can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2−k to the measure, which is impossible.  Thus the set of strings of length k in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\\n\\nAlgorithmic randomness \\nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. \\nCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed\\nthat a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin\\'s Ω number.\\n\\nIncompleteness theorem for halting probabilities \\n\\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant N such that no bit of Ω after the Nth can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant N depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to Gödel\\'s incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\\n\\nSuper Omega \\nAs mentioned above, the first n bits of Gregory Chaitin\\'s constant Ω are random or incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of Ω. In other words, the enumerable first n bits of Ω are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. Jürgen Schmidhuber (2000) constructed a limit-computable \"Super Ω\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable Ω, as one cannot significantly compress the Super Ω by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\\n\\nFor an alternative \"Super Ω\", the universality probability of a prefix-free Universal Turing Machine (UTM) namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem (i.e., using Turing Jump notation).\\n\\nSee also \\n Incompleteness theorem\\n Kolmogorov complexity\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nWorks cited\\n Cristian S.

       "       'In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned. A single outcome may be an element of many different events, and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes. An event consisting of only a single outcome is called an  or an ; that is, it is a singleton set. An event  is said to  if  contains the outcome  of the experiment (or trial) (that is, if ). The probability (with respect to some probability measure) that an event  occurs is the probability that  contains the outcome  of an experiment (that is, it is the probability that ). \\nAn event defines a complementary event, namely the complementary set (the event  occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?\\n\\nTypically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event (that is, all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite. So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events (see Events in probability spaces, below).\\n\\nA simple example\\n\\nIf we assemble a deck of 52 playing cards with no jokers, and draw a single card from the deck, then the sample space is a 52-element set, as each card is a possible outcome.  An event, however, is any subset of the sample space, including any singleton set (an elementary event), the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one).  Other events are proper subsets of the sample space that contain multiple elements.  So, for example, potential events include:  \\n\\n \"Red and black at the same time without being a joker\" (0 elements),\\n \"The 5 of Hearts\" (1 element),\\n \"A King\" (4 elements),\\n \"A Face card\" (12 elements),\\n \"A Spade\" (13 elements),\\n \"A Face card or a red suit\" (32 elements),\\n \"A card\" (52 elements).\\nSince all events are sets, they are usually written as sets (for example, {1, 2, 3}), and represented graphically using Venn diagrams. In the situation where each outcome in the sample space Ω is equally likely, the probability  of an event  is the following :\\n\\nThis rule can readily be applied to each of the example events above.\\n\\nEvents in probability spaces\\n\\nDefining all subsets of the sample space as events works well when there are only finitely many outcomes, but gives rise to problems when the sample space is infinite. For many standard probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, the sample space is the set of real numbers or some subset of the real numbers. Attempts to define probabilities for all subsets of the real numbers run into difficulties when one considers \\'badly behaved\\' sets, such as those that are nonmeasurable. Hence, it is necessary to restrict attention to a more limited family of subsets. For the standard tools of probability theory, such as joint and conditional probabilities, to work, it is necessary to use a σ-algebra, that is, a family closed under complementation and countable unions of its members. The most natural choice of σ-algebra is the Borel measurable set derived from unions and intersections of intervals. However, the larger class of Lebesgue measurable sets proves more useful in practice.\\n\\nIn the general measure-theoretic description of probability spaces, an event may be defined as an element of a selected -algebra of subsets of the sample space.  Under this definition, any subset of the sample space that is not an element of the -algebra is not an event, and does not have a probability.  With a reasonable specification of the probability space, however, all  are elements of the -algebra.\\n\\nA note on notation\\n\\nEven though events are subsets of some sample space  they are often written as predicates or indicators involving random variables. For example, if  is a real-valued random variable defined on the sample space  the event\\n\\ncan be written more conveniently as, simply,\\n\\nThis is especially common in formulas for a probability, such as\\n\\nThe set  is an example of an inverse image under the mapping  because  if and only if\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n Formal definition in the Mizar system.\\n\\nExperiment (probability theory)',\n",
       "       'Bertrand\\'s box paradox is the name used for a veridical paradox in elementary probability theory. It was first posed by Joseph Bertrand in his 1889 work Calcul des Probabilités.\\n\\nThere are three boxes: \\n a box containing two gold coins,\\n a box containing two silver coins,\\n a box containing one gold coin and one silver coin.\\n\\nThe question is to calculate the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin drawn from the same box also being a gold coin.\\n\\nA veridical paradox is when the correct solution to a puzzle appears to be counterintuitive. It may seem intuitive that the probability that the remaining coin is gold should be , but the probability is actually . However, this is not the paradox Bertrand referred to. He showed that if  were correct, it would lead to a contradiction, so  cannot be correct.\\n\\nThis simple but counterintuitive puzzle is used as a standard example in teaching probability theory. The solution illustrates some basic principles, including the Kolmogorov axioms.\\n\\nSolution\\n\\nThe problem can be reframed by describing the boxes as each having one drawer on each of two sides. Each drawer contains a coin. One box has a gold coin on each side (GG), one a silver coin on each side (SS), and the other a gold coin on one side and a silver coin on the other (GS). A box is chosen at random, a random drawer is opened, and a gold coin is found inside it. What is the chance of the coin on the other side being gold?\\n\\nThe following faulty reasoning appears to give a probability of :\\nOriginally, all three boxes were equally likely to be chosen.\\nThe chosen box cannot be box SS.\\nSo it must be box GG or GS.\\nThe two remaining possibilities are equally likely. So the probability that the box is GG, and the other coin is also gold, is .\\n\\nThe flaw is in the last step. While those two cases were originally equally likely, the fact that you are certain to find a gold coin if you had chosen the GG box, but are only 50% sure of finding a gold coin if you had chosen the GS box, means they are no longer equally likely given that you have found a gold coin. Specifically:\\n\\nThe probability that GG would produce a gold coin is 1.\\nThe probability that SS would produce a gold coin is 0.\\nThe probability that GS would produce a gold coin is .\\n\\nInitially GG, SS and GS are equally likely . Therefore, by Bayes rule the conditional probability that the chosen box is GG, given we have observed a gold coin, is:\\n\\nThe correct answer of  can also be obtained as follows:\\nOriginally, all six coins were equally likely to be chosen.\\nThe chosen coin cannot be from drawer S of box GS, or from either drawer of box SS.\\nSo it must come from the G drawer of box GS, or either drawer of box GG.\\nThe three remaining possibilities are equally likely, so the probability that the drawer is from box GG is .\\n\\nAlternatively, one can simply note that the chosen box has two coins of the same type  of the time. So, regardless of what kind of coin is in the chosen drawer, the box has two coins of that type  of the time. In other words, the problem is equivalent to asking the question \"What is the probability that I will pick a box with two coins of the same color?\".\\n\\nBertrand\\'s point in constructing this example was to show that merely counting cases is not always proper. Instead, one should sum the probabilities that the cases would produce the observed result; and the two methods are equivalent only if this probability is either 1 or 0 in every case. This condition is correctly applied in the second solution method, but not in the first.\\n\\nThe paradox as stated by Bertrand\\nIt can be easier to understand why  is incorrect, if you consider the paradox Bertrand used. After a box has been chosen, but before a drawer is opened, there is a  probability that the box has two of the same kind of coin. So, if you then select a drawer at random, before you open it the probability that the other drawer has the same kind of coin is . Opening the drawer that you selected cannot change that.\\n\\nExperimental data\\n\\nIn a survey of 53 Psychology freshmen taking an introductory probability course, 35 incorrectly responded ; only 3 students correctly responded .\\n\\nRelated problems\\nOther veridical paradoxes in probability include:\\n Boy or Girl paradox\\n Monty Hall problem\\n Three Prisoners problem\\n Two envelopes problem\\n Sleeping Beauty problem\\n\\nThe Monty Hall and Three Prisoners problems are mathematically identical to Bertrand\\'s Box paradox. The construction of the Boy or Girl paradox is similar, essentially adding a fourth box with a gold coin and a silver coin. Its answer is controversial, based on how one assumes the \"drawer\" was chosen.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nNickerson, Raymond (2004).

       "       \"In probability theory, the optional stopping theorem (or Doob's optional sampling theorem) says that, under certain conditions, the expected value of a martingale at a stopping time is equal to its initial expected value. Since martingales can be used to model the wealth of a gambler participating in a fair game, the optional stopping theorem says that, on average, nothing can be gained by stopping play based on the information obtainable so far (i.e., without looking into the future). Certain conditions are necessary for this result to hold true. In particular, the theorem applies to doubling strategies.\\n\\nThe optional stopping theorem is an important tool of mathematical finance in the context of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing.\\n\\nStatement \\nA discrete-time version of the theorem is given below:\\n\\nLet  be a discrete-time martingale and  a stopping time with values in }, both with respect to a filtration . Assume that one of the following three conditions holds:\\n() The stopping time  is almost surely bounded, i.e., there exists a constant  such that  a.s.\\n() The stopping time  has finite expectation and the conditional expectations of the absolute value of the martingale increments are almost surely bounded, more precisely,  and there exists a constant  such that  almost surely on the event } for all .\\n() There exists a constant  such that  a.s. for all  where  denotes the minimum operator.\\nThen  is an almost surely well defined random variable and \\n\\nSimilarly, if the stochastic process  is a submartingale or a supermartingale and one of the above conditions holds, then\\n\\nfor a submartingale, and\\n\\nfor a supermartingale.\\n\\nRemark \\nUnder condition\\xa0() it is possible that  happens with positive probability. On this event  is defined as the almost surely existing pointwise limit of  , see the proof below for details.\\n\\nApplications\\nThe optional stopping theorem can be used to prove the impossibility of successful betting strategies for a gambler with a finite lifetime (which gives condition\\xa0()) or a house limit on bets (condition\\xa0()).  Suppose that the gambler can wager up to c dollars on a fair coin flip at times 1, 2, 3, etc., winning his wager if the coin comes up heads and losing it if the coin comes up tails.  Suppose further that he can quit whenever he likes, but cannot predict the outcome of gambles that haven't happened yet.  Then the gambler's fortune over time is a martingale, and the time  at which he decides to quit (or goes broke and is forced to quit) is a stopping time.  So the theorem says that .  In other words, the gambler leaves with the same amount of money on average as when he started.  (The same result holds if the gambler, instead of having a house limit on individual bets, has a finite limit on his line of credit or how far in debt he may go, though this is easier to show with another version of the theorem.)\\nSuppose a random walk starting at  that goes up or down by one with equal probability on each step.  Suppose further that the walk stops if it reaches  or ; the time at which this first occurs is a stopping time.  If it is known that the expected time at which the walk ends is finite (say, from Markov chain theory), the optional stopping theorem predicts that the expected stop position is equal to the initial position .  Solving  for the probability  that the walk reaches  before  gives .\\nNow consider a random walk  that starts at  and stops if it reaches  or , and use the  martingale from the examples section. If  is the time at which  first reaches , then . This gives .\\nCare must be taken, however, to ensure that one of the conditions of the theorem hold. For example, suppose the last example had instead used a 'one-sided' stopping time, so that stopping only occurred at , not at . The value of  at this stopping time would therefore be . Therefore, the expectation value  must also be , seemingly in violation of the theorem which would give . The failure of the optional stopping theorem shows that all three of the conditions fail.\\n\\nProof\\nLet  denote the stopped process, it is also a martingale (or a submartingale or supermartingale, respectively). Under condition\\xa0() or\\xa0(), the random variable  is well defined. Under condition\\xa0() the stopped process  is bounded, hence by Doob's martingale convergence theorem it converges a.s. pointwise to a random variable which we call .\\n\\nIf condition\\xa0() holds, then the stopped process  is bounded by the constant random variable . Otherwise, writing the stopped process as\\n\\ngives  for all , where\\n\\n.\\n\\nBy the monotone convergence theorem\\n\\n.\\n\\nIf condition\\xa0() holds, then this series only has a finite number of non-zero terms, hence  is integrable.\\n\\nIf condition\\xa0() holds, then we continue by inserting a conditional expectation and using that the event } is known at time  (note that  is assumed to be a stopping time with respect to the filtration), hence\\n\\nwhere a representation of the expected value of non-negative integer-valued random variables is used for the last equality.\\n\\nTherefore, under any one of the three conditions in the theorem, the stopped process is dominated by an integrable random variable . Since the stopped process  converges almost surely to , the dominated convergence theorem implies\\n\\nBy the martingale property of the stopped process,\\n\\nhence\\n\\nSimilarly, if  is a submartingale or supermartingale, respectively, change the equality in the last two formulas to the appropriate inequality.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Doob's Optional Stopping Theorem\\n\\nProbability theorems\\nTheorems in statistics\\nArticles containing proofs\\nMartingale theory\"],\n",

       "array(['AIDS (\"acquired immune deficiency syndrome\") is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Individuals with HIV have what is referred to as a \"HIV infection\". When infected semen, vaginal secretions, or blood come in contact with the mucous membranes or broken skin of an uninfected person, HIV may be transferred to the uninfected person (\"horizontal transfer\"), causing another infection. Additionally, HIV can also be passed from infected pregnant women to their uninfected baby during pregnancy and/or delivery (\"vertical transmission\"), or via breastfeeding. As a result of HIV infection, a portion of these individuals will progress and go on to develop clinically significant AIDS.\\n\\nHIV is a all is well, which comprise a large and diverse family of RNA viruses that make a DNA copy of their RNA genome after infection of a host cell. An essential step in the replication cycle of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is the integration of this viral DNA into the host DNA. The RNA genome of progeny virions and the template for translation of viral proteins are made when the integrated viral DNA is transcribed.\\n\\nBackground Information: HIV-1 Integrase\\n\\nThe integration of HIV DNA into the host DNA is a critical step in the HIV life cycle.  Understanding the integration process will provide a framework for gaining insight into multiple potential sites of therapeutic intervention for HIV infection and AIDS. HIV’s enzyme for inserting the DNA version of its genome into the host cell DNA is called its \"integrase\". HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the “cut-and-paste” action of clipping the host DNA and joining the proviral genome to the clipped ends. This protein, which is 288 amino acids in length, contains three “domains”, in this order:\\n\\n1. Amino (N)-terminal domain: Sometimes referred to as a \"zinc finger\", the N-terminal domain is composed of the conserved HHCC, His, and Cys residues, a motif that serves to bind zinc. The function of the N-terminal domain is not completely clear, but is thought to assist the integrase in forming multimers (fixed agglomerations of multiple integrase molecules).\\n\\n2. The central catalytic domain (or \"catalytic core\"): The catalytic core encompasses the DDE catalytic triad of amino acids, or acid residues, that manage binding with a divalent metal (usually Mg2+ or Mn2−), forming the active catalytic site. In the case of HIV-1 integrase, the residues are Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152. This domain is also well conserved during evolution.\\n\\nThe HIV-1 catalytic domain appears dimeric in solution and in crystal structures. The vast surface area of the dimer interface indicates that it is biologically significant. The insertion sites on each strand of target DNA are separated by 5 base pairs, which parallel to approximately 15 Å for helical B-form DNA, implying that the catalytic domain (or the functional unit) of integrase should contain a pair of active sites separated by a like spacing. This said, the spacing among the active sites in the virtually spherical dimer is, however, apparently not very well-matched with the spacing among the insertion sites on the two strands of target DNA, as examination of crystal structures appears to reveal that the active sites in the dimers are separated by more than 30 Å when measured in a straight line through the proteins, and by an even greater distance when measured around the circumference of the dimer. Under the assumption that the dimer interface is preserved in the functional integrase multimer, at minimum a tetramer of integrase must be required for the complete integration reaction to proceed.\\n\\n3. The Carboxy (C)- terminal domain : The C-terminal domain non-specifically binds DNA. Since the sites of integration into the target DNA are relatively non-specific, it is thought that this domain may work together in some fashion with the target DNA. Information retrieved from experiments with chimeric integrases show that recognition of the target site is controlled by the core domain. Cross-linking studies also suggest that the C-terminal domain works together with a subterminal region just inside the very ends of the viral DNA.\\n\\nDuring the integration process, the HIV integrase enzyme performs two key catalytic reactions. First is the 3’ processing of the HIV DNA, followed by strand transfer of the HIV DNA into the host DNA. The integration of HIV DNA can occur either in dividing or resting cells, and the HIV integrase enzyme can exist in the form of a monomer, dimer, tetramer, and possibly even higher-order forms (such as octomers). Each HIV particle has an estimated 40 to 100 copies of the integrase enzyme.\\n\\nIntegrase functions are unique to retroviruses; human cells are not required to cut-and-paste pieces of DNA into the genome. For this reason, integrase inhibitors are prime targets for developing drug therapies for HIV infection and AIDS, since inhibition of integrase should not hamper the normal operations in human cells.\\n\\nHIV Integration Mechanism\\n\\nHIV integration is the insertion of HIV genetic material into the genome of the infected cell. The process of HIV integration involves six sequential steps:\\n\\nBinding of HIV Integrase to HIV DNA\\nThe first step of the integration process occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell following the completion of reverse transcription of the HIV RNA into c-DNA. This step involves the binding of integrase - most likely in the dimer form - to each end of the newly formed HIV c-DNA. The binding takes place at specific sequences in the long terminal repeat regions. The integrase-HIV DNA complex is part of an intracellular nucleoprotein particle known as the \"preintegration complex\" (PIC). This complex consists of linear HIV DNA, viral proteins, and host proteins. The viral proteins include integrase, nucleocapsid, matrix, viral protein R (Vpr), and reverse transcriptase. Several host proteins can also form part of this complex, although it is unclear whether some or all join the preintegration complex prior to nuclear transport.\\n\\nProcessing of the HIV DNA 3’ ends\\nIn the second step of the integration process, which also takes place in the host cytoplasm, the integrase dimer cleaves the viral DNA at each 3’ end. This cleavage reaction removes GT dinucleotides on the 3’-side of a conserved CA dinucleotide region. The cleavage of the dinucleotide at each viral DNA 3’-end generates a dinucleotide 5’ \"overhang\" and a reactive intermediate that contains a 3’-hydroxyl group. This 3’ processing step is the first of two key catalytic reactions performed by the integrase enzyme, and it prepares the viral DNA for integration into the host DNA. In an alternative view of the DNA binding and 3’-processing reaction, the tetramer form of integrase (not the dimer) binds to the ends of the HIV DNA, and then cleaves the 3’ ends.\\n\\nTranslocation of HIV integrase to the host cell nucleus (Nuclear Translocation)\\nIn the third step of the integration process, the preintegration complex is transported into the nucleus of the host cell, entering through one of the nuclear pore complexes.\\n\\nBinding of the preintegration complex to the host DNA\\nInside the nucleus, the host protein lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75, commonly referred to in abbreviated form as LEDGF/p75, binds to the preintegration complex and the host DNA. The LEDGF/p75 serves as a tethering protein (or bridge) between the preintegration complex and the host DNA. The sequence of binding of the LEDGF/p75, the host DNA, and the preintegration complex remains unclear. In one version, the LEDGF/p75 binds first to the preintegration complex and then to the host DNA. On the other hand, LEDGF/p75 may bind first to the host DNA and then to the preintegration complex. Regardless of the sequence, it is believed that the presence of LEDGF/p75 results in the integrase dimers approaching each other to form a tetramer.\\n\\nTransfer of HIV DNA into the host DNA (Strand Transfer)\\nThe next step, the strand transfer reaction, takes place inside the host cell nucleus and involves the critical step of inserting the HIV DNA into a selected region of the host DNA. The region of insertion contains a weakly conserved palindromic sequence. This strand transfer reaction is initiated as the HIV integrase catalyzes the HIV DNA 3’-hydroxyl group attack on the host DNA.  The attack by the HIV DNA occurs on opposite strands of the host DNA in a staggered fashion, typically 4-6 base pairs apart. This reaction leads to separation of the bonds in the host DNA base pairs located between the staggered cuts, and the joining of the HIV 3’-hydroxyl groups with the host DNA 5’ phosphate ends. At this point, the newly joined viral-host DNA region unfolds.\\n\\nRepair of the gaps formed in the strand transfer process (\"Gap Repair\")\\n\\nFollowing the strand transfer process, the HIV-DNA and host DNA junctions have unpaired regions of DNA, referred to as DNA \"gaps\". In addition, the two base pairs at the end of the 5’ region of the viral DNA remain unpaired after the strand transfer. The insertion of the new HIV DNA and the remaining gaps that flank the integration site is currently thought to induce a host cellular DNA damage response, but much of this mechanism remains speculative. The host DNA damage response is thought to be critical in the final step of integration, known as \"gap repair\" and may require at least three host enzymes - polymerase, nuclease, and ligase. In the first step of gap repair, it is thought that the polymerase enzyme(s) extend(s) the host DNA on each end and, thus, fill in the gaps. Next, it is possible that host nuclease activity removes the 5’ dinucleotide \"flaps\" on the HIV DNA. Lastly, it is thought that the DNA ligase enzymes join the remaining unbound segment of the HIV and host DNA strands.   Currently this mechanism is largely validated experimentally and is an area under investigation.  This gap repair process completes the integration of the HIV DNA into the host DNA, with the fully integrated HIV DNA now being referred to as \"proviral DNA\".\\n\\nRole of splicing in HIV-1\\n\\nRecent study suggested that HIV-1 prefers integration into highly spliced genes or genes with more introns. This preference depends on the host chromatin binding protein LEDGF/p75 that interacts with many splicing factors. Another study showed that HIV-1 preference for highly spliced genes depends on another host factor CPSF6, a poly adenylation factor. Cancer genes with high number of introns are highly targeted by HIV-1.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n\\nHIV/AIDS',\n",
       "       'In molecular biology, Tat is a protein that is encoded for by the tat gene in HIV-1. Tat is a regulatory protein that drastically enhances the efficiency of viral transcription.\\nTat stands for \"Trans-Activator of Transcription\". The protein consists of between 86 and 101 amino acids depending on the subtype.  Tat vastly increases the level of transcription of the HIV dsDNA. Before Tat is present, a small number of RNA transcripts will be made, which allow the Tat protein to be produced. Tat then binds to cellular factors and mediates their phosphorylation, resulting in increased transcription of all HIV genes, providing a positive feedback cycle. This in turn allows HIV to have an explosive response once a threshold amount of Tat is produced, a useful tool for defeating the body\\'s response.\\n\\nTat also appears to play a more direct role in the HIV disease process. The protein is released by infected cells in culture, and is found in the blood of HIV-1 infected patients.\\n\\nIt can be absorbed by cells that are not infected with HIV, and can act directly as a toxin producing cell death via apoptosis in uninfected \"bystander\" T cells, assisting in progression toward AIDS.\\n\\nBy antagonizing the CXCR4 receptor, Tat also appears to selectively encourage the reproduction of less virulent M-tropic (macrophage-tropic) strains of HIV (which use the CCR5 receptor) early in the course of infection, allowing the more rapidly pathogenic T-tropic (T-cell-tropic) strains (which use the CXCR4 receptor) to emerge later after mutating from M-tropic strains.\\n\\nFunction and mechanism\\nLike other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating regulatory protein (Tat), which is essential for efficient transcription of the viral genome. Tat acts by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response element (TAR), found at the 5′ ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts. In binding to TAR, Tat alters the properties of the transcription complex, recruits the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) of cellular CDK9 and cyclin T1, and hence increases the production of full-length viral RNA.\\n\\nTat protein also associates with RNA polymerase II complexes during early transcription elongation after the promoter clearance and before the synthesis of full-length TAR RNA transcript. This interaction of Tat with RNA polymerase II elongation complexes is P-TEFb-independent. There are two Tat binding sites on each transcription elongation complex; one is located on TAR RNA and the other one on RNA polymerase II near the exit site for nascent mRNA transcripts which suggests that two Tat molecules are involved in performing various functions during a single round of HIV-1 mRNA synthesis.\\n\\nThe minimum Tat sequence that can mediate specific TAR binding in vitro has been mapped to a basic domain of 10 amino acids, comprising mostly Arg and Lys residues. Regulatory activity, however, also requires the 47 N-terminal residues, which interact with components of the transcription complex and function as a transcriptional activation domain.\\n\\nTat also uses an unusual transcellular transport pathway. Firstly, it binds with high affinity to Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), found on the inner surface of the cell membrane, this  enables Tat recruitment at this level. Tat then crosses the plasma membrane to reach the extracellular space.  Tat secretion by infected cells is highly active, and export is the major destination for HIV-1 Tat.\\n\\nStructure\\nThe basic region of HIV-Tat protein is suggested to form an alpha helix. The basic region is involved in RNA (TAR, trans-activation response element) binding and Tat proteins thus belong to the family of arginine-rich motif (ARM) RNA binding proteins.\\n\\nProtein transduction domain\\nTat contains a protein transduction domain, which is therefore known as a cell-penetrating peptide. Originally characterised by Frankel and Pabo (1988) and Green and Loewenstein (1988), this domain allows Tat to enter cells by crossing the cell membrane. The amino acid sequence of the protein transduction domain is YGRKKRRQRRR.\\nThe nuclear localisation signal found within the domain, GRKKR, mediates further translocation of Tat into the cell nucleus.  The biological role of this domain and exact mechanism of transfer is unknown.\\n\\nClinical significance\\nInhibition of Tat has been investigated. It has been suggested that Tat antagonists may be of use in the treatment of HIV infections.\\n\\nBiosantech has developed a novel vaccine called Tat Oyi, which aims at the Tat protein. The company\\'s HIV vaccine candidate is not toxic to 48 HIV-positive patients enrolled in a double-blind study taking place in France. A Phase I/IIa study, published in 2016, shows a reduction in viral RNA for one of three doses tested. A dose-dependent response was not observed, raising questions about the robustness of the findings.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHIV/AIDS\\nViral regulatory and accessory proteins',\n",

       "       \"Rev is a transactivating protein that is essential to the regulation of HIV-1 (and other lentiviral) protein expression. A nuclear localization signal is encoded in the rev gene, which allows the Rev protein to be localized to the nucleus, where it is involved in the export of unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs. In the absence of Rev, mRNAs of the HIV-1 late (structural) genes are retained in the nucleus, preventing their translation.\\n\\nHistory\\nA novel protein was found to be involved in the translation of gag and env mRNA. The unknown protein functioned by removing repression of regulatory sequences and was named Art (anti-repression transactivator).  Later studies suggested that the protein was involved in regulation of the RNA splicing mechanism. Therefore, the name of the protein was modified from Art to Trs (transregulator of splicing). The most recent studies have shown that the protein has multiple functions in the regulation of HIV-1 proteins, and its name has been changed to Rev (regulator of expression of virion proteins), which more generally describes its function.\\n\\nStructure \\nRev is a 13-kDa protein that is composed of 116 amino acids. Rev's sequence contains two specific domains which contribute to its nuclear import and export. The protein typically performs its function as a tetramer.\\n\\nArginine-rich motif\\nThe N-terminal region of Rev contains an arginine-rich sequence. The arginine-rich motif (ARM) is located between amino acids 38–49 of the rev gene and forms an alpha-helical secondary structure. The ARM is a highly specific sequence which allows for the multimerization of Rev proteins, prior to RNA binding. A single base substitution alters Rev's ability to form a tetramer. The arginine-rich domain of Rev interacts with the rev-binding element (RBE), which is part of the HIV Rev response element (RRE) located in an intron downstream of the env gene. The domain also contains a nuclear localization signal.\\n\\nRev-activation domain (Nuclear export signal)\\nRev's nuclear export signal is located in residues 71–82 of the C-terminal region and is leucine-rich. Binding of Rev to viral RNAs containing the RRE allows for mRNA export out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm by a mechanism different than that of cellular mRNAs.\\n\\nFunction \\nHIV-1 regulatory proteins (including Rev) are translated from completely processed mRNA transcripts, while structural proteins are translated from incompletely spliced transcripts. Completely spliced transcripts are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the same mechanism as cellular mRNA. However, Rev is needed to export incompletely spliced mRNAs in order to produce the viral structural proteins.\\n\\nRev localization to the nucleus\\nThe arginine-rich domain of the Rev protein, containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), allows Rev to enter the nucleus. Entry requires binding between a Rev multimer, Ran-GDP, and importin-β (a nuclear transport factor). The Rev NLS is a highly similar sequence to that of the importin-β-binding site present within importin-α, which allows for the interaction between Rev and importin-β. The NLS overlaps with the sequence required for RNA-binding. This prevents the NLS from counteracting the export of RRE-containing mRNA transcripts.\\n\\nBinding of Rev to the RRE\\nThe rev response element (RRE) is a 240 base-pair sequence located in the second intron of the HIV-1 genome, immediately downstream of the env gene. The RRE remains functional if translocated, but needs to remain in the same orientation (cannot be inverted). The RRE is retained by incompletely processed mRNA transcripts. The secondary structure of the RRE creates eight stem-loops. Rev initially binds to the purine-rich stem-loop IIB, then binds to a secondary site in stem-loop I.\\n\\nThe RRE sequence is cis-acting, and is necessary to achieve high levels of env mRNA in the cytoplasm. The RRE also facilitates multimerization of the Rev proteins, which is required for Rev binding and function. The Rev protein binds unspliced gag and pol transcripts and incompletely spliced env, vif, vpr and vpu transcripts at the RRE, facilitating export to the cytoplasm.\\n\\nGenomic export from the nucleus\\nRev is continuously shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The shuttling of Rev is regulated by its nuclear localization signal and its nuclear export signal. Once Rev is inside the nucleus, Ran-GDP is phosphorylated into Ran-GTP, causing the importation complex to disassemble. Upon disassembly, Rev's NES forms a new complex with CRM1 (exportin-1) and Ran-GTP at the RRE sequence within incompletely spliced transcripts. Following assembly of the complex, the intron-containing RNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Once the pre-mRNAs are in the cytoplasm, Rev dissociates, revealing the NLS. Exposure of the NLS allows for Rev interaction with importin-β in order to shuttle Rev back to the nucleus.\\n\\nRev-directed export of viral RNAs is similar to the mechanism by which snRNAs and the 5s rRNAs are exported, as opposed to the mechanism for export of cellular mRNAs. Rev is able to facilitate export of pre-mRNA transcripts that would otherwise typically remain in the nucleus, suggesting that the Rev NES is dominant over nuclear retention.\\n\\nRegulation of HIV gene expression\\nRev acts post-transcriptionally to positively regulate the expression of structural genes and to negatively regulate the expression of regulatory genes. Rev positively regulates the expression of gag, pol, and env. Rev-mediated export from the nucleus increases cytoplasmic levels of the structural mRNAs (gag, pol, and env). Gag, pol and env expression is lower in the absence of Rev and higher in the presence of Rev. Rev negatively regulates the expression of the regulatory genes (rev and tat) by creating a negative feedback loop, which regulates Rev production. There is a decrease in Rev production when Rev protein levels are higher than is necessary for the given amount of HIV-1 genome encoded. Rev also decreases the quantity of completely spliced viral messages expressed by exporting pre-mRNA before it can be spliced. This results in decreased expression of the regulatory proteins, Rev and Tat. Since Rev is continuously shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm, small amounts of the protein are able to impact many mRNA transcripts. Maintenance of the proper balance between early and late viral gene quantities leads to an overall increase in virion production.\\n\\nTransition from early to late phase HIV-1 genes\\nHIV-1 genes are expressed from either completely spliced RNA or from intron-containing RNA. The export of fully spliced mRNAs (early, regulatory genes) occurs in the same manner as the normal export of cellular mRNAs. On the other hand, unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs which code for the late, structural proteins are Rev-dependent. The Rev protein is expressed as an early gene from completely spliced transcripts, so the expression of late phase structural proteins cannot occur until an initial amount of Rev is produced.\\n\\nRev as a target for antiviral therapies\\nSince Rev is absolutely necessary for HIV-1 replication and it is expressed early on in infection, it has been suggested that Rev is a good target for antiviral therapies.\\n\\nLeptomycin B (LMB) binds to CRM1 which prevents the formation of the complex required for export(CRM1/NES/RanGTP/RRE) and ultimately reduces the production of incompletely spliced RNAs. Therefore, structural proteins, which are necessary for virion assembly, are not produced.\\n\\nIt has been shown that various organic compounds have the ability to target the Rev/RRE interaction. Neomycin B, diphenylfuran cation, and proflavine are small molecules that can prevent Rev from binding to the RRE sequence.  If Rev is incapable of binding to the RRE on the pre-mRNA, the RNA will not be exported to the cytoplasm, also resulting in lack of necessary structural proteins.\\n\\nOther therapies target the Rev protein itself, since it is an essential component of HIV-1 infection. M10 is a mutated form of Rev and has a single amino acid substitution (Aspartic acid to Leucine). If delivered to cells, Rev M10 will compete with the wild-type Rev protein for the RRE binding site, and therefore decrease Rev's normal cellular functions.\\n\\nDihydrovaltrate was also identified as a Rev-export inhibitory congener.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nHIV/AIDS\\nViral regulatory and accessory proteins\",\n",
       "       'Serine incorporator 5 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SERINC5 gene.\\n\\nProperties \\nSERINC5 is a protein belonging to the serine incorporator (SERINC) family, in the predicted membrane proteins class. It is believed that SERINC5 proteins help incorporate serine into certain lipid bilayer membranes; however, scientists are unsure of their primary function and physiology. Of the five proteins in the human SERINC family, their topologies are strikingly similar. Approximately 17% of amino acids are shared amongst these proteins.\\n\\nC-terminal Transmembrane Domain \\nSERINC proteins have about 10 to 11 transmembrane domains. For SERINC5 to localize itself to the plasma membrane to inhibit infectivity by viruses, an extra c-terminal transmembrane domain is required. This extra transmembrane domain allows the protein to express itself stably.\\n\\nAntagonistic Relationships \\nNef, glycoGag, and S2 viral proteins are located throughout HIV-1 virions that aid in the facilitation of retrovirus release. When present, SERINC5, in the absence of certain virulence factors, prohibits HIV retrovirus particles from fusing to the cell membrane and incorporating their genetic information into target cells. Because SERINC5 is primarily localized via the plasma membrane, and attaches to vesicles carrying virus particles, the restriction factor has the ability to greatly decrease viral infectivity in the early stages of infection. It has been observed in past experiments that the highest SERINC5 concentration, regardless the expression of Nef, decreased infectivity approximately 250-fold. Although poorly understood, it is believed that Nef is a primary cause for the destruction of SERINC5 and other restriction factors. When in the presence of virulence factors, specifically Nef, both SERINC5 and CD4 cells are downregulated through lysosomal degradation via the AP-2 endocytic pathway. This causes rapid infectivity, and an increase in viral load.\\n\\nReferences',\n",

When the virus genome is expressed in a cell the vinnexin gene from the virus is made into a functioning protein by the infected cell. The vinnexin protein is then incorporated into the host's cell membranes to alter the way the hosts cells communicate with each other. The altered communication aids the transmission and replication of the virus in complex ways. The communication structure that the vinnexin is involved in is the gap junction and vinnexin forms part of a wider family of proteins that are innexin homologues referred to as pannexins. So far Vinnexins have only been found in Adenovirus and the way they affect the functioning of innexins is being studied in great detail.\\n\\nDiscovery \\nVinnexin was first described in 2005 in an adenovirus as a gene homologue of an insect gap protein called innexin. Vinnexins were shown to be used by the adenovirus to help Incheon wasps successfully inject there eggs into the caterpillars they parasitize.\\n\\nStructure \\nThe ultrastructure of Vinnexin is yet to be studied in detail. As an innexin homologue that functions in a similar way to innexins vinnexins are likely to have four transmembrane segments (TMSs) and, like the vertebrate connexin gap junction protein, vinnexin subunits assemble together to form a channel in the plasma membrane of the cell.\\n\\nFunction \\nFundamentally vinnexins have been shown to behave like the native innexins in insects. They participate in gap junctions to form transmembrane communication channels.

       "       'Human Herpes Virus (HHV) Infected Cell Polypeptide 0 (ICP0) is a protein, encoded by the DNA of herpes viruses. It is produced by herpes viruses during the earliest stage of infection, when the virus has recently entered the host cell; this stage is known as the immediate-early or α (\"alpha\") phase of viral gene expression.  During these early stages of infection, ICP0 protein is synthesized and transported to the nucleus of the infected host cell. Here, ICP0 promotes transcription from viral genes, disrupts structures in the nucleus known as nuclear dots or promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and alters the expression of host and viral genes in combination with a neuron specific protein. At later stages of cellular infection, ICP0 relocates to the cell cytoplasm to be incorporated into new virion particles.\\n\\nHistory and background \\n\\nICP0 was identified as an immediate-early polypeptide product of Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection in 1976.  The gene, in HSV-1, from which ICP0 is produced is known as HSV-1 α0 (\"alpha zero\"), Immediate Early (IE) gene 1, or simply as the HSV-1 ICP0 gene. The HSV-1 ICP0 gene was characterized and sequenced in 1986.  This sequence predicted a 775 amino acid sequence with a molecular weight of 78.5 KDa.  At the time of gene isolation, ICP0 was known as IE110 as gel electrophoresis experiments performed prior to obtaining the gene sequence indicated the ICP0 protein weighed 110 kDa. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or sumoylation, were presumed to account for the actual protein size appearing 30 kDa larger than that of the predicted amino acid sequence.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nDismantle microtubule networks \\nICP0 co-localizes with α-tubulin, and dismantles host cell microtubule networks once it translocates to the cytoplasm.\\n\\nTranscription \\nIn HSV-1 infected cells, ICP0 activates transcription of many viral and cellular genes. It acts synergistically with HSV-1 immediate early (IE) protein, ICP4, and is essential for reactivation of latent herpes virus and viral replication.\\n\\nDegradation of antiviral pathways \\nICP0 is responsible for overcoming a variety of cellular antiviral responses. After translocating to the nucleus early in infection, ICP0 promotes degradation of many cellular antiviral genes, including those for nuclear body-associated proteins promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100, causing disruption of PML nuclear bodies and reduced cellular antiviral capacity. ICP0 also inhibits the activity of IFN regulatory factors (IRF3) and IRF7, which are key transcription factors that induce production of antiviral cytokines called interferons.\\nBarriers to viral replication induced  by interferons can also be overcome by the action of ICP0. This function of ICP0 also prevents production of RNase L, an enzyme that degrades single-stranded viral and cellular RNAs and induces host cell apoptosis in virus infected cells.\\n\\nInteraction with host cell SUMO-1 protein and disruption PML Nuclear Bodies \\n\\nSmall ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO-1) is a protein produced by human cells that is involved in the modification of many proteins, including human PML protein.\\nHSV-1 ICP0 and several of its homologs in other herpes viruses bind to SUMO-1 in a manner similar to endogenous proteins, causing depletion of SUMO-1, and disruption of nuclear bodies.\\n\\nInteraction with neuron-differentiating protein NRSF and protein cofactor coREST \\n\\nICP0 interacts with a human protein, known as  Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Factor (NRSF) or RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) that regulates differences in gene expression between cells of neuronal or non-neuronal origin; NRSF is found in non-neuronal cells but not in fully differentiated neurons.  This interaction is attributed to the partial similarity of ICP0 to the human protein CoREST, also called REST corepressor 1 (RCOR1), which combines with NRSF to repress expression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells.\\n\\nAlthough the full NRSF protein is not typically found in neurons, truncated forms of NRSF are produced that selectively control the expression of certain neurotransmitter channels in specialized neurons. Combination of ICP0 with these NRSF-like neuronal factors may silence herpes genes in neurons, blocking the production of other immediate-early genes such as ICP4 and reducing production of ICP22.  The repressed production of immediate-early HSV genes may contribute to the establishment of latency during infection with herpes viruses.\\n\\nCoREST and NRSF combine with another cellular protein, histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC) to form a HDAC/CoREST/NRSF complex. This complex silences production of the HSV-1 protein ICP4 by interfering with chromatin remodeling of the viral DNA that is necessary to allow viral gene transcription; it deacetylates histones associated with viral DNA in viral chromatin.  Furthermore, an NRSF-binding region is located between the viral genes expressing proteins ICP4 and ICP22.  ICP0 interacts with coREST, dissociating HDAC1 from CoREST/NRSF in the HDAC/CoREST/NRSF complex and preventing the silencing of the HSV genome in non-neuronal cells.\\n\\nSuppression of ICP0 activity\\n\\nInteraction with latency-associated RNA transcript (LAT) \\n\\nDuring latent infection a viral RNA transcript inhibits expression of the herpes virus ICP0 gene via an antisense RNA mechanism.  The RNA transcript is produced by the virus and accumulates in host cells during latent infection; it is known as Latency Associated Transcript (LAT).  A chromatin insulator region between promoters of the LAT and ICP0 genes of the HSV-1 genome may allow for the independent regulation of their expression.\\n\\nSilencing of ICP0 gene activity by ICP4 \\nAlthough it is tempting to hypothesize that LAT is the repressor of the ICP0 gene, evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. Recent data suggest that ICP4 strongly suppresses the ICP0 gene, and ICP0 antagonizes ICP4.  The balance between ICP0 and ICP4 dictates whether the ICP0 gene can be efficiently transcribed.\\n\\nHomologs across Herpes virus species \\n\\nThe ICP0 gene and protein from HSV-1 have orthologs in related viruses from the herpes virus family. HSV-2 ICP0 is predicted to produce a polypeptide of 825 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 81986 Da, and 61.5% amino acid sequence similarity to HSV-1 ICP0.  Simian varicella virus (SVV) is a varicellovirus that, like HSV-1 and HSV-2, belongs to the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of herpes viruses. SVV expresses an HSV-1 LAT ortholog known as SVV LAT, and an HSV-1 ICP0 ortholog known as SVV ORF-61 (Open Reading Frame 61).

       "       \"Gp41 also known as glycoprotein 41 is a subunit of the envelope protein complex of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Gp41 is a transmembrane protein that contains several sites within its ectodomain that are required for infection of host cells. As a result of its importance in host cell infection, it has also received much attention as a potential target for HIV vaccines.\\n\\nGene and post-translational modifications \\n\\nGp41 is coded with gp120 as one gp160 by the env gene of HIV. Gp160 is then extensively glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved by furin, a host cellular protease. The high glycosylation of the env coded glycoproteins allows them to escape the human body's immune system. In contrast to gp120, however, gp41 is less glycosylated and more conserved (less prone to genetic variations). Once gp160 has been cleaved into its individual subunits, the subunits are then associated non-covalently on the surface of the viral envelope.\\n\\nStructure \\nGp41 and gp120, when non-covalently bound to each other, are referred to as the envelope spike complex and are formed as a heterotrimer of three gp41 and three gp120. These complexes found on the surface of HIV are responsible for the attachment, fusion, and ultimately the infection of host cells. The structure is cage-like with a hollow center that inhibits antibody access. While gp120 sits on the surface of the viral envelope, gp41 is the transmembrane portion of the spike protein complex with a portion of the glycoprotein buried within the viral envelope at all times.\\n\\nGp41 has three prominent regions within the sequence: the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic domain. The ectodomain, which comprises residues 511-684, can be further broken down into the fusion peptide region (residues 512-527), the helical N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR). In addition to these regions, there is also a loop region that contains disulfide bonds that stabilize the hairpin structure (the folded conformation of gp41) and a region called the membrane proximal external region (MPER) which contains kinks that are antigen target regions. The fusion peptide region is normally buried or hidden by the non-covalent interactions between gp120 and gp41, at a point which looks torus-like. This prevents the fusion peptide from interacting with other regions that are not its intended target region.\\n\\nFunction \\n\\nIn a free virion, the fusion peptides at the amino termini of gp41 are buried within the envelope complex in an inactive non-fusogengic state that is stabilized by a non-covalent bond with gp120. Gp120 binds to a CD4 and a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4), found on susceptible cells such as Helper T cells and macrophages. As a result, a cascade of conformational changes occurs in the gp120 and gp41 proteins. These conformational changes start with gp120 that rearranges to expose the binding sites for the coreceptors mentioned above. The core of gp41 then folds into a six helical bundle (a coiled coil) structure exposing the previously hidden hydrophobic gp41 fusion peptides that are inserted in the host cell membrane allowing fusion to take place. This fusion process is facilitated by the hairpin conformational structure. The inner core of this conformation is 3 NHRs which have hydrophobic pockets that allow it to bind anti-parallel to specific residues on the CHR. The activation process occurs readily, which suggests that the inactive state of gp41 is metastable and the conformational changes allow gp41 to achieve its more stable active state. Furthermore, these conformational changes are irreversible processes.\\n\\nAs a drug target \\n\\nThe interaction of gp41 fusion peptides with the target cell causes a formation of an intermediate, pre-hairpin structure which bridges and fuses the viral and host membranes together. The pre-hairpin structure has a relatively long half-life which makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention and inhibitory peptides.\\n\\nEnfuvirtide (also known as T-20) is a 36-residue alpha-peptide fusion inhibitor drug that binds to the pre-hairpin structure and prevents membrane fusion and HIV-1 entry to the cell.  The vulnerability of this structure has initiated development towards a whole spectrum of fusion preventing drugs. In developing these drugs, researchers face challenges because the conformation that allows for inhibition occurs very quickly and then rearranges. Enfuviritide specifically has a low oral availability and is quickly processed and expelled by the body. Certain strains of HIV have also developed resistance to T-20. In order to circumvent the difficulties that come with using T-20, researchers have sought out peptide-based inhibitors. A variety of naturally occurring molecules have also been shown to bind gp41 and prevent HIV-1 entry.\\n\\nThe MPER is one region that has been studied as a potential target because of its ability to be recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), but it hasn't been a very good target because the immune response it elicits isn't very strong and because it is the portion of gp41 that enters the cell membrane (and it cannot be reached by antibodies then). In addition to antigen binding regions on MPER kinks, there are other targets that could prove to be effective antigen binding regions, including the hydrophobic pockets of the NHR core that is formed following the conformational change in gp41 that creates the six-helix bundle. These pockets could potentially serve as targets for small molecule inhibitors. The fusion peptide on the N-terminus of the gp41 is also a potential target because it contains neutralizing antibody epitopes. N36 and C34, or NHR- and CHR-based peptides (or short sequences of amino acids that mimic portions of gp41) can also act as effective antigens because of their high affinity binding. In addition to having a much higher affinity for binding when compared to its monomer, C34 also inhibits T-20 resistant HIV very well, which makes it a potentially good alternative to treatments involving enfuviritide. Small-molecule inhibitors that are able to bind to two hydrophobic pockets at once have also been show to be 40-60 times more potent and have potential for further developments. Most recently, the gp120-gp41 interface is being considered as a target for bNAbs.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n \\n\\nHIV/AIDS\\nGlycoproteins\\nViral structural proteins\",\n",
       "       'The HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) is a highly structured, ~350 nucleotide RNA segment present in the Env coding region of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNAs.  In the presence of the HIV-1 accessory protein Rev, HIV-1 mRNAs that contain the RRE can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for downstream events such as translation and virion packaging.\\n\\nRRE and HIV-1 biology\\n\\nEarly phase\\n\\nThe HIV-1 genome contains a single promoter and uses multiple reading frames and alternative splicing to encode 15 proteins from a single pre-mRNA species.  Transcription from an integrated HIV-1 provirus generates a single 9 kilobase (kb) pre-mRNA containing multiple splice sites and nuclear retention signals.  In the early phase of the viral life cycle, this pre-RNA is completely spliced to RRE-free, 2 kb messages.  These smaller messages are then transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via standard mRNA nuclear export pathways  (see Figure). One of these small, 2kb messages encodes the HIV-1 Rev protein which is imported into the nucleus via its nuclear localization sequence. This phase of the virus life cycle is both Rev and RRE independent.\\n\\nLate phase\\n\\nThe late phase of the viral life cycle is characterized by the expression of viral proteins that are encoded on the long, unspliced (9kb) or partially spliced (4 kb) messages containing the RRE. Because of their retention and splicing signals, these intron-containing RNAs are initially retained in the nucleus for splicing/degradation.  However, after a sufficient level of Rev has been produced by the 2 kb messages, these longer messages can be exported to the cytoplasm via a Rev dependent export pathway.  Nuclear export of these RNAs is achieved by a specific, co-operative assembly of multiple Rev molecules on the RRE.  Assembly of this Rev-RRE complex is followed by the recruitment of a human protein complex containing the proteins exportin-1 (XPO1/CRM1) and Ran-GTP. Rev recruits this export machinery via a nuclear export sequence (NES) present in Rev. This Rev-RRE-Xpo1/RanGTP complex is then transported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, these messages are translated to produce all the remaining viral proteins or packaged as genomes for newly budding virions  (see Figure).\\n\\nSecondary Structure and Rev Recognition\\n\\nThe RRE is a highly structured RNA element. Computational predictions, later verified by chemical and enzymatic probing, indicate that RRE contains multiple stem loops and bulges (see Figure). Rev binds to RRE in a sequence specific manner with Rev-RNA recognition mediated by a 17-residue a-helical stretch on Rev, the Arginine-Rich-Motif (ARM).\\n\\nStem IIB: a high-affinity binding site\\n\\nStem IIB is a site on the RRE which Rev binds with high affinity and specificity.  The structure of an isolated stem IIB bound to a peptide corresponding to a Rev-ARM has been solved by NMR. This structure reveals an RNA A-form major groove widened by purine-purine base pairs at the purine-rich bulge to accommodate the a-helical Rev-ARM. Binding is achieved through a combination of base-specific contacts and electrostatic contacts with the phosphate backbone (see figure).  More recent studies have identified another region on the RRE, stem IA, that binds Rev in a specific manner, but with a 5-fold weaker affinity than stem IIB.\\n\\nCo-operative Rev assembly required for RRE function\\n\\nAlthough Stems IIB and IA can bind Rev in isolation, a full-length RRE (at least ~250 nt) is required for viral function. Multiple molecules of Rev bind to the full RRE in a specific and co-operative manner through a combination of Rev-RNA and Rev-Rev interactions. It is believed that IIB acts as an \"anchor point\", with the Rev molecules bound at secondary sites (such as IA) stabilized by protein-protein interactions with other Rev molecules (in addition to the RNA-protein interactions).  Biochemical studies on a 242-nucleotide RRE have established a ratio of 6 Rev monomers to each RRE.\\n\\nIn a sense, the RRE acts as a scaffolding platform onto which a specific and co-operative complex of Revs (and eventually cellular export machinery) assembles. This cooperativity that is dictated by RRE structure and sequence is required for the formation of a high affinity, export-competent complex. Current models of Rev assembly on the RRE suggest an initial Rev nucleation event at stem IIB followed by progressive addition of Rev molecules to form the full complex.\\n\\nRev-RRE Complexes recruit additional partners\\n\\nAfter assembly of a Rev-RRE complex, cellular export machinery must be added to guide the RNA through the nuclear pore. Nuclear export of Rev-RRE containing mRNAs is achieved using the human Crm1-RanGTP nuclear export pathway.  Rev contains  a nuclear export sequence (NES) that binds Crm1, and Crm1 guides the entire complex out of the nucleus.\\n\\nRecent crystal structures of Rev, the Rev-ARM/Stem IIB structure and the information on Rev-RRE stoichiometry have led to the proposal of a jelly-fish model for a functionally active complex. In this model, The RRE provides a structural scaffold to assemble a Rev hexamer, and this assembly forms the head of the jelly-fish. The NESs from the 6 Rev monomers form the jelly-fish \"tentacles\" that could interact with the host Crm1-RanGTP proteins. This entire \"jellyfish\" would then be exported to the cytoplasm (see Figure).\\n\\nTertiary structure\\n\\nImages of the tertiary structure of RRE (and the Rev-RRE complex) have been captured using atomic force microscopy.  These images show a globular \"head\" with a long stalk extending from it and are in accordance with 3D predictions from computer models, as well as electron microscope (EM) images of assembled Rev-RRE complexes.\\n\\nRev-RRE as a Drug Target\\n\\nAs the export of RRE-containing RNAs is essential for HIV replication, the association of RRE and Rev is an attractive therapeutic target. Various RNA cleavage methods and small molecule screens have been implemented in an effort to design antiviral drugs to treat HIV infection. Rev and RRE are particularly attractive drug targets as both elements exist in reading frames that code other proteins (Tat and Env for Rev, Env for RRE), theoretically restricting potential escape mutations.  However, to date there are no clinically approved therapies that target Rev-RRE.\\n\\nRelationship to Other Viruses\\n\\nAll complex retroviruses face the problem of exporting unspliced and partially spliced mRNAs.  Some use systems similar to Rev/RRE; these include HIV-2 and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) which use their own Rev-RRE systems,  some betaretroviruses, which use a Rem/RmRE system, and all deltaretroviruses which use a Rex/RxRRE systems.\\n\\nMany simple retroviruses, most notably Mason–Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), do not encode a Rev-like protein, but instead have evolved a cis-acting RNA element, the constitutive transport element (CTE), that directly binds to components of the host mRNA export machinery.  The MPMV CTE is ~220 nucleotides and consists of two identical binding sites for the cellular export protein Tap. Tap directly binds the viral RNA and exports it to the cytoplasm.\\n\\nSee also\\nHIV Ribosomal frameshift signal\\nRetrovirus direct repeat 1 (dr1)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n http://www.scripps.edu/mb/millar/research/rev.htm\\n\\nCis-regulatory RNA elements',\n",
       "       \"NS2-3 protease (of hepatitis C virus, HCV) is an enzyme responsible for proteolytic cleavage between NS2 and NS3, which are non-structural proteins that form part of the HCV virus particle. NS3 protease of hepatitis C virus, on the other hand, is responsible for the cleavage of non-structural protein downstream. Both of these proteases are directly involved in HCV genome replication, that is, during the viral life-cycle that leads to virus multiplication in the host that has been infected by the virus.\\n\\nBackground about Hepatitis C \\nHepatitis C affects 170 million people around the world which includes 1.4 million people living in the U.S. Most of the people infected with this virus live in third-world countries which often tend to have poor sterilization of medical equipment, a common source of HCV infection. Education also plays a big part as a vast majority of people don’t have access to the information about the virus, how it spreads and infects. Hepatitis C can enter human body through many ways which include sexual intercourse, blood transfusion and via HCV infected needles. HCV infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer if interferon treatment fails.\\n\\nViral genome\\nHepatitis C virus is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Flaviviridae. The genome consists made up of about 10,000 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) used host cell machinery to process its genome to synthesize 3 crucial viral proteases of which each has peptide cleaving role. These 3 proteases are also known as structural proteins. The HCV genome encodes 10 viral proteins: C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nNS2-3 protease is the enzyme responsible for proteolytic cleavage between the non-structural proteins NS2 and NS3. NS3 protease, on the other hand, is responsible for the cleavage of non-structural proteins downstream. Both of these proteases are directly involved in HCV genome replication. NS2-3 protease mechanism is essential for viral production, as shown by in-vitro chimpanzee studies where chimps which were inoculated with HCV with fully mutated NS2-3 protease activity didn’t develop HCV infection.\\n\\nTo this date, a promising cell-culture system has yet to be developed in a way that could support large scale need of future vaccine trials. The use of HCV non-structural proteins to initiate immune response in animal studies have shown promising results but the lack of robust tissue culture system and the ability of virus to mutate rapidly are still major hurdles. Interferon treatment has succeeded in only very small number of patients.\\n\\nIn the study discussed in this paper, Dentzer has succeeded in finding the actual viral protease domain and predicting possible ways to inhibit the protease mechanism.\\n\\nInhibitors for protease such as Papain, Subtilisin and one from Sindbis virus capsid might share some similarities as they all are cysteine proteases. If NS2-3 protease does share important similarities with other cysteine proteases, it might be possible to propose a model for inhibition of the NS2-3 cysteine protease activity, which might be able to offer a permissible approach to a robust vaccine for in-vitro animal model studies.\\n\\nThe team of researchers used native selenomethionine-containing protein that yielded crucial crystal forms. NS2 Pro (non-structural protease) monomer is made up of two sub-domains which is connected by a linker. Each monomer contains the anti-parallel alpha-helices and a loop of beta strands. NS2 dimer consists of two monomers each facing their N and C-termini toward each other. N-termini stay in close proximity while C-termini are farther apart from each other which resembles ‘butterfly’. NS2-3 protease is 42 kDa in length. Earlier studies also suggested that it was almost impossible to isolate NS2-3 protease due to hydrophobic nature of the native NS2.\\n\\nResearchers have used a method called ‘Crystallization’ through which they have been able to isolate and further investigate role of NS2-3 protease. His143, Cys184 and Glu 163 are the three crucial resides responsible for proteolytic activity. These three residues together form an active site. Although NS2 protease has been proposed to have a unique fold, it is shown that superimposing three critical residues from other cysteine proteases revealed a major characteristic which would allow for more specific inhibitor studies. Researchers in this case used cysteine proteases such as papain and poliovirus 3C protease. NS2 dimer contains two active sites and requires dimerization for proteolytic activity.\\n\\nThere are also some critical residues including Pro 164 which help bend the peptide backbone of the Glu163 to offer the correct geometry so the catalytic process can occur. Cis-proline on the other hand offers dimer stability. The NS2-3 protease requires both NS2 and NS3 domain for proteolytic cleavage. Addition of Zinc is also required as NS2-3 protease is zinc dependent which releases N terminus of NS2. The tetrahedral geometry in active site hints at the zinc ion binding site. Although NS3 domain's active role is not known yet, scientist propose that NS3 may interact with the active site of NS2 which would provided with catalytic environment necessary for polyprotein processing. The presence of zinc-binding site doesn't necessarily mean that a devoid of zinc in the process would inhibit the viral catalytic process.\\n\\nAn experimental model was devised to test if HCV full-length polyprotein sequence with a mutation (either H143A or C184A) would give NS2-3 cleaved polyprotein. Expression of two mutants in the same experimental model should yield NS2 and NS3 as it would provide with one active site. As the data shown in the paper, NS2 and NS3 were cleaved which meant that co-expression of two mutants did yield at least one functional active site.\\nThis experiment also provided a model for membrane association that would help with future studies regarding inhibitors for NS2-3 protease which is crucial for viral replication.\\n\\nThe article has proposed the structure for NS2-3 cysteine protease active site and provided with in-vitro co-expression mutation study results which would change the way researchers currently look at polyprotein processing.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n\\nEnzymes\\nHepatitis C virus\",\n",
       "       'A fusion mechanism is any mechanism by which cell fusion or virus–cell fusion takes place, as well as the machinery that facilitates these processes. Cell fusion is the formation of a hybrid cell from two separate cells. There are three major actions taken in both virus–cell fusion and cell–cell fusion: the dehydration of polar head groups, the promotion of a hemifusion stalk, and the opening and expansion of pores between fusing cells. Virus–cell fusions occur during infections of several viruses that are health concerns relevant today. Some of these include HIV, Ebola, and influenza. For example, HIV infects by fusing with the membranes of immune system cells. In order for HIV to fuse with a cell, it must be able to bind to the receptors CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Cell fusion also occurs in a multitude of mammalian cells including gametes and myoblasts.\\n\\nViral mechanisms\\n\\nFusogens \\nProteins that allow viral or cell membranes to overcome barriers to fusion are called fusogens.  Fusogens involved in virus-to-cell fusion mechanisms were the first of these proteins to be discovered. Viral fusion proteins are necessary for membrane fusion to take place. There is evidence that ancestral species of mammals may have incorporated these same proteins into their own cells as a result of infection.  For this reason, similar mechanisms and machinery are utilized in cell–cell fusion.\\n\\nIn response to certain stimuli, such as low pH or binding to cellular receptors, these fusogens will change conformation. The conformation change allows the exposure of hydrophobic regions of the fusogens that would normally be hidden internally due to energetically unfavorable interactions with the cytosol or extracellular fluid. These hydrophobic regions are known as fusion peptides or fusion loops, and they are responsible for causing localized membrane instability and fusion.  Scientists have found the following four classes of fusogens to be involved with virus–cell or cell–cell fusions.\\n\\nClass I fusogens \\nThese fusogens are trimeric, meaning they are made of three subunits. Their fusion loops are hidden internally at the junctions of the monomers before fusion takes place. Once fusion is complete, they refold into a different trimeric structure than the structure they had before fusion. These fusogens are characterized by a group of six α-helices in their post-fusion structure. This class of fusogens contains some of the proteins utilized by influenza, HIV, coronaviruses, and Ebola during infection. This class of fusogens also includes syncytins, which are utilized in mammalian cell fusions.\\n\\nClass II fusogens \\nClass II fusogens contain multiple β-pleated sheets. These proteins are also trimeric and take part in the insertion of fusion loops into the target membrane. Their conformation changes can be triggered by exposure to acidic environments.\\nClass II fusogens have a structure distinct from Class I fusogens, but similarly lower the energy barrier for membrane fusion. Class I fusogens are involved in flaviviruses (tick-borne encephalitis);  alphaviruses (Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, chikungunya and rubella); and phleboviruses (Rift Valley fever virus and Uukuniemi virus).\\n\\nClass III fusogens \\nClass III fusogens are involved with virus–cell fusions. Much like fusogens in the previous two classes, these proteins are trimeric. However, they contain both α-helices and  β-pleated sheets. During cell fusion the monomers of these proteins will dissociate but will return to a different trimeric structure after the fusion is complete. They are also involved in the insertion of fusion loops in the membrane.\\n\\nClass IV fusogens \\nThese reoviral cell–cell fusogens contain fusion loops that can induce cell fusion. They form polymeric structures to induce fusion of membranes. Reoviruses do not have membranes themselves, so class IV fusogens are not usually involved in traditional virus–cell fusion. However, when they are expressed on the surface of cells, they can induce cell–cell fusion.\\n\\nClass I–III mechanism \\nThe fusogens of classes I–III have many structural differences. However, the method they utilize to induce membrane fusion is mechanistically similar. When activated, all of these fusogens form elongated trimeric structures and bury their fusion peptides into the membrane of the target cell. They are secured in the viral membrane by hydrophobic trans-membrane regions. These fusogens will then fold in on themselves forming a structure that is reminiscent of a hairpin. This folding action brings the transmembrane region and the fusion loop adjacent to each other. Consequently, the viral membrane and the target cell membrane are also pulled close together. As the membranes are brought closer together, they are dehydrated, which allows the membranes to be brought into contact. Interactions between hydrophobic amino-acid residues and the adjacent membranes cause destabilization of the membranes. This allows the phospholipids in the outer layer of each membrane to interact with each other. The outer leaflets of the two membranes form a hemifusion stalk to minimize energetically unfavorable interactions between hydrophobic phospholipid tails and the environment. This stalk expands, allowing the inner leaflets of each membrane to interact. These inner leaflets then fuse, forming a fusion pore. At this point, the cytoplasmic components of the cell and the virus begin to mix. As the fusion pore expands, virus–cell fusion is completed.\\n\\nMammalian cell fusion mechanisms \\nThough there is much variation in different fusions between mammalian cells, there are five stages that occur in a majority of these fusion events: \"programming fusion-competent status, chemotaxis, membrane adhesion, membrane fusion, and post-fusion resetting.\"\\n\\nProgramming fusion-competent status \\nThis first step, also known as priming, encompasses the necessary events that must take place in order for cells to gain the ability to fuse.  In order for a cell to become fusion-competent, it must manipulate the make-up of its membrane to facilitate membrane fusion. It also must construct necessary proteins to mediate fusion. Finally, it must eliminate hindrances to fusion. For example, a cell might free itself from the extracellular matrix in order to allow the cell more motility to facilitate fusion.\\n\\nMonocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts \\nMonocytes and macrophages can become fusion-competent in response to cytokines, which are protein-signalling molecules. Some interleukins prompt monocytes and macrophages to fuse to form foreign-body giant cells as part of a body\\'s immune response. For example, interleukin-4 can promote the activation of transcription factor STAT6 by phosphorylation. This can then trigger expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). MMP9 can degrade proteins in the extracellular matrix, which aids in the priming of macrophages for fusion.\\n\\nOsteoclasts are multinucleated bone-resorbing cells. They are formed by the fusion of differentiated monocytes, much like foreign-body giant cells. However, the molecules that induce fusion-competence in macrophages that are destined to become osteoclasts are different from those that promote formation of foreign-body giant cells. For instance, transcription factor NFATC1 regulates genes that are specific to osteoclast differentiation.\\n\\nHaploid cells \\nZygote formation is a crucial step in sexual reproduction, and it is reliant on the fusion of sperm and egg cells. Consequently, these cells must be primed to gain fusion-competence.  Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid that usually resides on the inner layer of the cell membrane. After sperm cells are primed, phosphatidylserine can be found on the outer leaflet of the membrane. It is thought that this helps stabilize the membrane at the head of the sperm, and that it may play a role in allowing the sperm to enter the zona pellucida that covers egg cells. This unusual location of phosphatidylserine is an example of membrane restructuring during priming for cell fusion.\\n\\nChemotaxis \\nChemotaxis is the process of recruitment in response to the presence of certain signal molecules. Cells that are destined to fuse are attracted to each other via chemotaxis. For example, sperm cells are attracted to the egg cell through signalling by progesterone. Similarly, in muscle tissue, myoblasts can be recruited for fusion by IL-4.\\n\\nMembrane adhesion \\nBefore cells can fuse, they must be in contact with one another. This can be accomplished through cell recognition and attachment by cellular machinery. Syncytin-1 is a Class I fusogen involved in the fusion of cells to form osteoclasts in humans. During the early actions of Class I fusogens in cell fusion, they insert their fusion loops into a target membrane. Consequently, the action of syncytin-1 is an example of membrane adhesion as it links the two cells together to prepare them for fusion. This step also encompasses the dehydration of the membranes at the site of fusion. This is necessary to overcome the energy requirements necessary for fusion and to ensure that the membranes are in very close proximity for fusion to occur.\\n\\nMembrane fusion \\nMembrane fusion is characterized by the formation of a fusion pore, which allows the internal contents of both cells to mix. It is first accomplished by the mixing of lipids of the outer layers of the fusing membranes, which forms a hemifusion stalk. Then the inner leaflets can interact and fuse, creating an open gap where the membranes have fused. This gap is the fusion pore. This process is mediated by fusogens. Fusogens are highly conserved in mammals, and it is theorized that mammals adopted them after infection by retroviruses. Because they are highly conserved, they perform their task through a similar mechanism to the one used by viral fusogens as previously described. It is theorized that actin polymerization and other actions of the cytoskeleton might aid in the widening of the fusion pore to complete fusion.\\n\\nPost-fusion resetting \\nUpon the completion of fusion, the machinery used to fuse must be disassembled or altered to avoid fusion of the new, multinucleated cell with more cells. One example of this is the final trimeric structure taken on by Class I, II, and III fusogens. They each take on a structure that is markedly different than their form before fusion occurred. This likely alters their activity, preventing them from initiating another fusion.\\n\\nSee also \\n Cell–cell fusogens\\n Multinucleated cells\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHIV/AIDS\\nCell biology',\n",
       "       'Long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs), sometimes also called elite controllers, are individuals infected with HIV, who maintain a CD4 count greater than 500 without antiretroviral therapy with a detectable viral load. Many of these patients have been HIV positive for 30 years without progressing to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS. They have been the subject of a great deal of research, since an understanding of their ability to control HIV infection may lead to the development of immune therapies or a therapeutic vaccine.  The classification \"Long-term non-progressor\" is not permanent, because some patients in this category have gone on to develop AIDS.\\n\\nLong-term nonprogressors typically have viral loads under 10,000 copies /mL blood, do not take antiretrovirals, and have CD4+ counts within the normal range. Most people with HIV not on medication have viral loads which are much higher.\\n\\nIt is estimated that around 1 in 500 people with HIV are long-term nonprogressors. Without the symptoms of AIDS, many LTNP patients may not know they are infected.\\n\\nGenetic traits that confer greater resistance or more robust immune response to HIV are thought to explain why LTNP patients are able to live much longer with HIV than patients who are not LTNP. Some LTNP are infected with a weakened or inactive form of HIV, but it is now known that many LTNP patients carry a fully virulent form of the virus. Genetic traits that may affect progression include:\\n Gene mutation: A mutation in the FUT2 gene affects the progression of HIV-1 infection. 20% of Europeans who have that mutation are called \"non secretor\" because of their absence of a certain type of antigen that also provides strong resistance against norovirus.\\n Mitochondrial DNA: Different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in humans may increase or decrease rates of AIDS progression. Haplotypes associated with more loosely coupled mitochondrial respiration, with reduced ATP and ROS generation, have been associated with faster progression and vice versa.\\n Receptor mutations: A low percentage of long-term nonprogressors have been shown to have inherited mutations of the CCR5 receptor of T cell lymphocytes.  HIV uses CCR5 to enter these cells.  It is believed that the Δ32 (delta 32) variant of CCR5 impairs HIV ability to infect cells and cause disease.  An understanding of this mechanism led to the development of a class of HIV medicines, the entry inhibitors. The presence of this mutation, however, is not a unifying theme among LTNPs and is observed in an exceedingly small number of these patients.\\n HLA type has also been correlated with long-term non-progressor cohorts. In particular, strong correlations have been found between possessing the class 1 HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5703, and/or HLA-B*2705 alleles and ability to exert control over HIV.\\n Antibody production: All individuals with HIV make antibodies against the virus. In most patients, broadly neutralizing antibodies do not emerge until approximately 2–4 years after the initial infection. At this point, the latent reservoir has already been established and the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies is not enough to prevent disease progression. In some rare patients, these antibodies emerge earlier and can result in a delayed disease course. These patients, however, are not typically classified as LTNPs, but rather as slow progressors, who will eventually develop AIDS. Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies in healthy individuals is a potential strategy for a preventive HIV vaccine, as is the elicitation of these antibodies through rationally designed immunogens. Direct production of these antibodies in somatic tissue through plasmid transfection also poses a viable method for making these antibodies endogenously.\\n APOBEC3G protein production: In a small number of people infected with HIV, the virus is naturally suppressed without medical treatment. These people may carry high quantities of a protein called APOBEC3G that disrupts viral replication in cells. APOBEC3G, or \"A3\" for short, is a protein that sabotages reverse transcription, the process HIV relies on for its replication. This process involves the virus transcribing its single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA that is incorporated into the cell\\'s genome. A3 usually stops dormant viruses in the human genome, called endogenous retroviruses, from reawakening and causing infections.\\n\\nThe \\'long-term nonprogressors\\' term is used for HIV carriers only but the wide term asymptomatic carrier is well-known for many other infections.\\n\\nClearance of the virus \\nRecently there have been reports of elite controllers who maintain undetectable viral loads, in 2019 Loreen Willenberg from USA was announced as the first such case and in 2021 a patient from Argentina dubbed \"the Esperanza patient\" after the town where she live. Willemberg had antiretroviral therapy but stopped the treatment at some point while the Esperanza patient only took antiretroviral therapy while pregnant yet even years after their immune systems have kept the virus with no remaining detectable viral load. This could inform the development of a \"sterilising cure\" therapy.\\n\\nSee also \\n\\n Innate resistance to HIV\\n HIV/AIDS research\\nStephen Crohn \\nTimothy Ray Brown (The Berlin patient)\\nAdam Castillejo (the London patient)\\nHIV-positive people\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n The International HIV Controllers Study\\n The Zephyr Foundation\\n\\nHIV/AIDS\\nHIV/AIDS research',\n",

       "       'Major capsid protein VP1 is a viral protein that is the main component of the polyomavirus capsid. VP1 monomers are generally around 350 amino acids long and are capable of self-assembly into an icosahedral structure consisting of 360 VP1 molecules organized into 72 pentamers. VP1 molecules possess a surface binding site that interacts with sialic acids attached to glycans, including some gangliosides, on the surfaces of cells to initiate the process of viral infection. The VP1 protein, along with capsid components VP2 and VP3, is expressed from the \"late region\" of the circular viral genome.\\n\\nStructure \\nVP1 is the major structural component of the polyomavirus icosahedral capsid, which has T=7 symmetry and a diameter of 40-45\\xa0nm. The capsid contains three proteins; VP1 is the primary component and forms a 360-unit outer capsid layer composed of 72 pentamers. The other two components, VP2 and VP3, have high sequence similarity to each other, with VP3 truncated at the N-terminus relative to VP2. VP2 and VP3 assemble inside the capsid in contact with VP1, with a stoichiometry of one VP2 or VP3 molecule to each pentamer. VP1 is capable of self-assembly into virus-like particles even in the absence of other viral components. This process requires bound calcium ions and the resulting particles are stabilized by, but do not require, inter-pentamer disulfide bonds.\\n\\nThe VP1 protein monomer is primarily composed of beta sheets folded into a jelly roll fold. Interactions between VP1 molecules within a pentamer involve extensive binding surfaces, mediated in part by interactions between edge beta-strands. The VP1 C-terminus is disordered and forms interactions between neighboring pentamers in the assembled capsid. The flexibility of the C-terminal arm will enable it to adopt different conformations in the six distinct interaction environments imposed by the symmetry of the icosahedral assembly. The C-terminus also contains a basic nuclear localization sequence, while the N-terminus - which is oriented toward the center of the assembled capsid - contains basic residues that facilitate non-sequence-specific interactions with DNA.\\n\\nFunction and trafficking\\n\\nThe VP1 protein is responsible for initiating the process of infecting a cell by binding to sialic acids in glycans, including some gangliosides, on the cell surface. Canonically, VP1 interacts specifically with α(2,3)-linked and α(2,6)-linked sialic acids. In some cases additional factors are necessary conditions for viral entry; for example, JC virus requires the 5HT2A serotonin receptor for entry, although the specific mechanism of this requirement is unclear. Once attached to the cell surface, the virions enter the cell and are trafficked by a retrograde pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum. The exact mechanism of endocytosis varies depending on the virus, and some viruses use multiple mechanisms; caveolae-dependent mechanisms are common. The process by which polyomaviruses penetrate the membrane and exit the ER is not well understood, but conformational changes to VP1, possibly including reduction of its disulfide bonds, likely occur in the ER. For some polyomaviruses, VP1 has been detected reaching the nucleus along with the viral genome, though it is unclear how the genomic DNA disengages from VP1.\\n\\nAll of the capsid proteins are expressed from the late region of the viral genome, so named because expression occurs only late in the infection process. VP1 has a nuclear localization sequence that enables import from the cytoplasm where it is synthesized by the host translation machinery to the cell nucleus where new virions are assembled. This nuclear import process, mediated by karyopherins, acts on assembled VP1 pentamers in complex with VP2 or VP3; oligomerization to form capsids occurs in the nucleus.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nViral structural proteins\\nPolyomavirus proteins',\n",

       "       'In virology, a spike protein or peplomer protein is a protein that forms a large structure known as a spike or peplomer projecting from the surface of an enveloped virus. The proteins are usually glycoproteins that form dimers or trimers.\\n\\nHistory and etymology\\nThe term \"peplomer\" refers to an individual spike from the viral surface; collectively the layer of material at the outer surface of the virion has been referred to as the \"peplos\". The term is derived from the Greek peplos, \"a loose outer garment\", \"robe or cloak\", or \"woman[\\'s] mantle\". Early systems of viral taxonomy, such as the Lwoff-Horne-Tournier system proposed in the 1960s, used the appearance and morphology of the \"peplos\" and peplomers as important characteristics for classification. More recently, the term \"peplos\" is considered a synonym for viral envelope.\\n\\nProperties\\nSpikes or peplomers are usually rod- or club-shaped projections from the viral surface. Spike proteins are membrane proteins with typically large external ectodomains, a single transmembrane domain that anchors the protein in the viral envelope, and a short tail in the interior of the virion. They may also form protein-protein interactions with other viral proteins, such as those forming the nucleocapsid.  They are usually glycoproteins, more commonly via N-linked than O-linked glycosylation.\\n\\nFunctions\\nSpikes typically have a role in viral entry. They may interact with cell-surface receptors located on the host cell and may have hemagglutinizing activity as a result, or in other cases they may be enzymes. For example, influenza virus has two surface proteins with these two functions, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The binding site for the cell-surface receptor is usually located at the tip of the spike.  Many spike proteins are membrane fusion proteins. Being exposed on the surface of the virion, spike proteins can be antigens.\\n\\nExamples\\nSpikes or peplomers can be visible in electron micrograph images of enveloped viruses such as orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, and retroviruses.\\n\\nCoronaviruses\\nCoronaviruses exhibit coronavirus spike protein, also known as the S protein, on their surfaces; S is a class I fusion protein and is responsible for mediating viral entry as the first step in viral infection. It evolves fast, by point mutations and by homologous recombination (its genomic region is a recombination hotspot). It is highly antigenic and accounts for most antibodies produced by the immune system in response to infection. For this reason the spike protein has been the focus of development for COVID-19 vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. A subgenus of the betacoronaviruses, known as embecoviruses (not including SARS-like coronaviruses), have an additional shorter surface protein known as hemagglutinin esterase.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated identification of viral particles in electron micrographs of patient tissue samples. A number of reports misidentified normal subcellular structures as coronaviruses due to their superficial resemblance to coronavirus morphology, and because the distinctive spikes of coronaviruses are apparent by negative stain but much less visible in thin section.\\n\\nInfluenza viruses\\nMost influenza virus subgroups have two surface proteins described as peplomers, neuraminidase (an enzyme) and hemagglutinin (also a class I fusion protein). Some instead have a single hemagglutinin esterase protein with both functions.\\n\\nRetroviruses\\nRetroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have surface peplomers. These are protein complexes formed by two proteins, gp41 and gp120, both expressed from the env gene, collectively forming a spike protein complex that mediates viral entry.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\nSee also\\nViral entry\\nViral life cycle\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nVirology'],\n",

       "       'Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT syndrome), is a rare headache disorder that belongs to the group of headaches called trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TACs). Symptoms include excruciating burning, stabbing, or electrical headaches mainly near the eye and typically these sensations are only on one side of the body. The headache attacks are typically accompanied by cranial autonomic signs that are unique to SUNCT. Each attack can last from five seconds to six minutes and may occur up to 200 times daily. \\n\\nTACs are caused by activation of the autonomic nervous system of the trigeminal nerve in the face. \\n\\nAs of 2015 about 50 cases have been described in the medical literature. Onset of the symptoms usually come later in life, at an average age of about 50. Although the majority of patients are men over the age of 50, it is not uncommon to find SUNCT present among other age groups, including children and infants.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nPeople affected by SUNCT often describe their headache attacks as excruciating pain. The attacks are severe enough to disrupt daily activities, but hospitalization is not necessary for most affected individuals.\\n\\nFrequency and duration\\nThe average number of attacks per day is around 60, ranging from 3 to 200 times.\\n\\nThe attacks can be divided into three groups: single stabs, groups of stabs, and attacks with saw-tooth pattern, from the shortest to the longest duration respectively. The attacks usually last from five seconds to 240 seconds. Typically, longer attacks are more painful due to psychological effects, and patients often feel agitated before and during the attack. They occur mostly in the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal region, but can also occur in the retro-orbital (behind the orbit of the eye) region, side, top, and back of head, second and third trigeminal divisions, teeth, neck, and ear.\\n\\nCranial autonomic symptoms associated with headache attacks\\nSUNCT often accompanies cranial autonomic symptoms, including lacrimation (tear flow), ipsilateral ptosis (drooping of the eyelid which is on the same side as the attacks), eyelid edema (swelling due to fluid accumulation), nasal blockage, and conjunctival injection (redness of eye). Depending on which division of the trigeminal nerve innervates the area affected, autonomic symptoms may be less obvious. Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic features (SUNA) is a subset of SUNCT and may be diagnosed when fewer autonomic symptoms are observed during attacks. \\n\\nThe majority of SUNCT attacks occur chronically; however, some occur episodically. In chronic SUNCT, attacks can occur regularly or irregularly without a distinct refractory period, whereas in episodic SUNCT, attacks occur only for a certain period of time and then cease for another period. Episodes of attacks last from a few days to a few months, and up to 22 attack episodes in one year have been observed. SUNCT can go into remission even after a chronic period, and relapse either spontaneously or due to some stimulus.\\n\\nTriggers of headache attacks\\n\\nMost of the time SUNCT occurs spontaneously; however, attacks can be triggered by simple daily stimuli such as touching the face or scalp, washing, chewing, eating, talking, coughing, blowing nose, or showering. They also can be triggered by light (including sunlight and fluorescent lights) and injuries. Stimuli capable of triggering a cluster headache, including alcohol, smoke, strong smells and a warm environment, can also trigger SUNCT in a few patients.\\nIn some cases, patients with episodic SUNCT only exhibit symptoms biannually, in spring and fall. This periodicity suggests that the hypothalamus, which is responsive to day length and photoperiod for regulating circadian and seasonal rhythms, has a role in its triggering.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nSUNCT must be properly distinguished from cluster headaches, since cluster headaches also occur several times per day with separate attacks, and share some common symptoms. However, cluster headaches usually last longer (up to three hours), occur less often (three to five attacks per day), and do not accompany cranial autonomic symptoms. IHS standard criteria for the diagnosis of SUNCT specifically includes pain in the trigeminal division of the face, especially in the orbital region, often with cranial autonomic symptoms which last for relatively short periods of time (from five seconds to several minutes) up to 100 times per day. SUNCT is a major subset of SUNA, which does not accompany cranial symptoms; complete separation between the two is inappropriate since SUNCT does not necessarily always accompany cranial autonomic signs. Exact statistical data is not available due to common mis-diagnosis, and setting up diagnostic criteria is important.\\n\\nThe International Headache Classification established by the International Headache Society criteria for diagnosing SUNCT for therapeutic purposes is:\\n\\n(i) Type of attack\\xa0– Attacks of unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal areas from stabbing or pulsating pain accompanied by ipsilateral conjunctival injection and lacrimation\\n(ii) Number of attacks per day\\xa0– 3 to 200 attacks per day\\n(iii) Attack load in minutes per day\\xa0– 5–240 seconds\\n\\nSymptoms of SUNCT often lead to misdiagnosis as paroxysmal hemicrania, which is also categorized in the same group. Inefficiency of indomethacin usually indicates SUNCT over paroxysmal hemicrania.\\n\\nMisdiagnosis and indecisive diagnosis in the past has made it difficult to obtain accurate statistics about SUNCT. Proper diagnosis will broaden data availability and facilitate discovery of new treatment options and useful statistics.\\n\\nPathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of SUNCT is incompletely understood. Recent studies suggest the existence of a relationship between the hypothalamus and the condition.\\nFunctional MRI and deep brain stimulation of a large patient pool showed activation of the posterior hypothalamus during attacks of primary SUNCT, on both sides and contralaterally (on the opposite side). Functional MRI studies suggest brain stem activation during attacks as well. Activation of the trigeminocervical complex and other related structures results from innervation from branches of trigeminal and upper cervical nerves.\\nThere exists a direct connection between trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which is located in the brain stem, and the posterior hypothalamus. Therefore, it is possible that stimulation of the peripheral trigeminal nerve activates the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus in turn communicates with the trigeminal nucleus caudalis via neurotransmitters such as orexin.\\n\\nElevated levels of prolactin, secretion of which is regulated by the hypothalamus, seem to be associated with SUNCT attacks. Some patients with a pituitary tumor only experience attacks at night. These patients only exhibit higher levels of prolactin at night, even where hormone levels, including prolactin, were normal throughout the day.\\n\\nSUNCT is considered a primary headache (or condition), but can also occur as a secondary symptom of other conditions. However, a patient can only be diagnosed with SUNCT as a primary condition.\\n\\nA pituitary tumor causes SUNCT as a secondary headache. Some patients with a pituitary tumor complain of short-lasting heachaches. Upon removal of the tumor, the symptoms of SUNCT may disappear permanently.\\n\\nAlthough it occurs very rarely, paranasal sinusitis can also cause secondary SUNCT. The symptoms of SUNCT in such cases can be removed permanently with endoscopic sinus surgery.\\n\\nTreatment\\nAs diagnostic criteria have been indecisive and its pathophysiology remains unclear, no permanent cure is available. Antiepileptic medications (membrane-stabilizing drugs) such as pregabalin, gabapentin, topiramate, and lamotrigine improve symptoms, but there is no effective permanent or long-term treatment for SUNCT.\\nHowever, a few short-term treatments are available and can relieve and possibly prevent some symptoms of attacks.\\nLamotrigine exhibits some long-term prevention and reduction in many patients; however, titration of dose is difficult due to adverse skin reactions.\\nTopiramate also has preventive effects but it is accompanied by a high risk of severe side-effects for patients with a history of kidney stones, glaucoma, depression, or low body weight.\\n\\nIntravenous lidocaine can abolish symptoms during its administration, or reduce frequency and duration of attacks. However, administration of intravenous lidocaine requires careful monitoring of ECG and blood pressure.\\nMethylprednisolone therapy shows some promise in short-term prevention of attacks, even though its mechanism of action is yet to be discovered.\\n\\nThe calcium channel blocker verapamil is reported to be useful in alleviating symptoms (lower frequency and duration of attacks), even though some patients experience worsened symptoms.\\n\\nVarious medications that are often used in other headache syndromes such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists do not relieve the symptoms of SUNCT.\\n\\nThere have been attempts to alter oxygen supply during attacks to alleviate the symptoms since some of the headaches are caused by decreased oxygen supply; however, elevated blood oxygen level did not affect the symptoms.\\n\\nResearchers now focus on the administration of various combination of medications and therapies to treat symptoms of SUNCT.\\n\\nHistory\\nIn 1977, a 62-year-old male patient was the first to be diagnosed with SUNCT. The patient had experienced unilateral, mild pain in the ocular and periorbital areas since he was 30 years old. The patient started to experience more severe attacks after being struck by a fishing rod in the lower medial supraorbital area when he was 58 years old. The attacks could be provoked by mechanical stimuli and occurred more frequently with symptoms of conjuctival injection, lacrimation, and rhinorrhea. The definitive diagnosis and determination of the role of the trauma (fishing rod strike) could not be made until 10 years later when another similar case occurred. Conditions of the next case ruled out the possibility of SUNCT being a post-traumatic headache.\\n\\nBad Brains singer H.R. has this disorder, as revealed by his wife.\\n\\nSee also\\nOphthalmodynia periodica\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n NINDS SUNCT Information Page\\n International Classification of Headache Disorders\\n\\nHeadaches',\n",
       "       \"Tension headache, also known as stress headache, or tension-type headache (TTH), is the most common type of primary headache. The pain can radiate from the lower back of the head, the neck, eyes or other muscle groups in the body typically affecting both sides of the head. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches.\\n\\nPain medication, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are effective for the treatment of tension headache. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. Evidence is poor for SSRIs, propranolol and muscle relaxants.\\n\\nAs of 2016, tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively).\\n\\nSigns and symptoms \\nAccording to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, the attacks must meet the following criteria:\\n\\n A duration of between 30 minutes and 7 days.\\n At least two of the following four characteristics:\\n bilateral location\\n pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) quality\\n mild or moderate intensity\\n not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs\\n Both of the following:\\n no nausea or vomiting\\n no more than one of photophobia (sensitivity to bright light) or phonophobia (sensitivity to loud sounds)\\n\\nTension-type headaches may be accompanied by tenderness of the scalp on manual pressure during an attack.\\n\\nRisk factors \\nVarious precipitating factors may cause tension-type headaches in susceptible individuals:\\n\\n Anxiety\\n Stress\\n Sleep problems\\n Young age\\n Poor health\\n\\nMechanism \\nAlthough the musculature of the head and neck and psychological factors such as stress may play a role in the overall pathophysiology of TTH, neither is currently believed to be the sole cause of the development of TTH. The pathologic basis of TTH is most likely derived from a combination of personal factors, environmental factors, and alteration of both peripheral and central pain pathways. Peripheral pain pathways receive pain signals from pericranial (around the head) myofascial tissue (protective tissue of muscles) and alteration of this pathway likely underlies episodic tension-type headache (ETTH). In addition to these myofascial tissue pain signals, pericranial muscle tenderness, inflammation, and muscle ischemia have been postulated in headache literature to be causal factors in the peripheral pathophysiology of TTH. However, multiple studies have failed to illustrate evidence for a pathologic role of either ischemia or inflammation within the muscles. Pericranial tenderness is also not likely a peripheral causal factor for TTH, but may instead act to trigger a chronic pain cycle in which the peripheral pain response is transformed over time into a centralized pain response. It is then these prolonged alterations in the peripheral pain pathways that lead to increased excitability of the central nervous system pain pathways, resulting in the transition of episodic tension-type headache into chronic tension type headache (CTTH). Specifically, the hyperexcitability occurs in central nociceptive neurons (the trigeminal spinal nucleus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex) resulting in central sensitization, which manifests clinically as allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH. Additionally, CTTH patients exhibit decreased thermal and pain thresholds which further bolsters support for central sensitization occurring in CTTH.\\n\\nThe alterations in physiology that lead to overall process of central sensitization involve changes at the level of neural tracts, neurotransmitters and their receptors, the neural synapse, and the post-synaptic membrane. Evidence suggests dysfunction in supraspinal descending inhibitory pain pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of central sensitization in CTTH.\\n\\nNeurotransmitters\\n\\nSpecific neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters thought to be most involved include NMDA and AMPA receptors, glutamate, serotonin (5-HT), β-endorphin, and nitric oxide (NO). Of the neurotransmitters, NO plays a major role in central pain pathways and likely contributes to the process of central sensitization. Briefly, the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) forms NO which ultimately results in vasodilatation and activation of central nervous system pain pathways. Serotonin may also be of significant importance and involved in malfunctioning pain filter located in the brain stem. The view is that the brain misinterprets information—for example from the temporal muscle or other muscles—and interprets this signal as pain. Evidence for this theory comes from the fact that chronic tension-type headaches may be successfully treated with certain antidepressants such as nortriptyline. However, the analgesic effect of nortriptyline, as well as amitriptyline in chronic tension-type headache, is not solely due to serotonin reuptake inhibition, and likely other mechanisms are involved.\\n\\nSynapses\\nRegarding synaptic level changes, homosynaptic facilitation and heterosynaptic facilitation are both likely to be involved in central sensitization. Homosynaptic facilitation occurs when synapses normally involved in pain pathways undergo changes involving receptors on the post-synaptic membrane as well as the molecular pathways activated upon synaptic transmission. Lower pain thresholds of CTTH result from this homosynaptic facilitation. In contrast, heterosynaptic facilitation occurs when synapses not normally involved in pain pathways become involved. Once this occurs innocuous signals are interpreted as painful signals. Allodynia and hyperalgesia of CTTH represent this heterosynaptic facilitation clinically.\\n\\nStress\\nIn the literature, stress is mentioned as a factor and may be implicated via the adrenal axis. This ultimately results in downstream activation of NMDA receptor activation, NFκB activation, and upregulation of iNOS with subsequent production of NO leading to pain as described above.\\n\\nDiagnosis \\nWith TTH the physical exam is expected to be normal with perhaps the exception of either pericranial tenderness upon palpation of the cranial muscles, or presence of either photophobia or phonophobia.\\n\\nClassification \\n\\nThe International Headache Society's most current classification system for headache disorders is the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) as of 2018. This classification system separates tension-type headache (TTH) into two main groups: episodic (ETTH) and chronic (CTTH). CTTH is defined as fifteen days or more per month with headache for greater than three months, or one-hundred eighty days or more, with headache per year. ETTH is less than fifteen days per month with headache or less than one-hundred eighty days with headache per year. However, ETTH is further sub-divided into frequent and infrequent TTH. Frequent TTH is defined as ten or more episodes of headache over the course of one to fourteen days per month for greater than three months, or at least twelve days per year, but less than one-hundred eighty days per year. Infrequent TTH is defined as ten or more episodes of headache for less than one day per month or less than twelve days per year. Furthermore, all sub-classes of TTH can be classified as having presence or absence of pericranial tenderness, which is tenderness of the muscles of the head. Probable TTH is utilized for patients with some characteristics, but not all characteristics of a given sub-type of TTH.\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis \\nExtensive testing is not needed as TTH is diagnosed by history and physical. However, if symptoms indicative of a more serious diagnosis are present, a contrast enhanced MRI may be utilized. Furthermore, giant cell arteritis should be considered in those 50 years of age and beyond. Screening for giant cell arteritis involves the blood tests of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein.\\nMigraine\\n Oromandibular dysfunction \\n Sinus disease\\n Eye disease\\n Cervical spine disease\\n Infection in immunocompromised\\n Intracranial mass\\n Idiopathic intracranial hypertension \\nMedication overuse headache\\n Secondary headache (headache due to other disorder)\\nGiant cell arteritis ( ≥50 years of age)\\nDermatochalasis\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nLifestyle\\nGood posture might prevent headaches if there is neck pain.\\n\\nDrinking alcohol can make headaches more likely or severe.\\n\\nDrinking water and avoiding dehydration helps in preventing tension headache.\\n\\nPeople who have jaw clenching might develop headaches, and getting treatment from a dentist might prevent those headaches.\\n\\nUsing stress management and relaxing often makes headaches less likely.\\n\\nBiofeedback techniques may also help.\\n\\nMedications\\nPeople who have 15 or more headaches in a month may be treated with certain types of daily antidepressants which act to prevent continued tension headaches from occurring. In those who are predisposed to tension type headaches the first-line preventative treatment is amitriptyline, whereas mirtazapine and venlafaxine are second-line treatment options. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be useful for prevention. Tricyclic antidepressants have been found to be more effective than SSRIs but have greater side effects. Evidence is poor for the use of SSRIs, propranolol, and muscle relaxants for prevention of tension headaches.\\n\\nTreatment \\nTreatment for a current tension headache is to drink water and confirm that there is no dehydration. If symptoms do not resolve within an hour for a person who has had water, then stress reduction might resolve the issue.\\n\\nExercise \\nEvidence supports simple neck and shoulder exercises in managing ETTH and CTTH for headaches associated with neck pain. Exercises include stretching, strengthening and range of motion exercises. CTTH can also benefit from combined therapy from stress therapy, exercises and postural correction.\\n\\nMedications\\n\\nEpisodic \\nOver-the-counter drugs, like paracetamol, aspirin, or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen), can be effective but tend to only be helpful as a treatment for a few times in a week at most. For those with gastrointestinal problems (ulcers and bleeding), acetaminophen is the better choice over aspirin, though both provide roughly equivalent pain relief. It is important to note that large daily doses of paracetamol should be avoided as it may cause liver damage especially in those that consume 3 or more drinks/day and those with pre-existing liver disease.  Ibuprofen, one of the NSAIDs listed above, is a common choice for pain relief but may also lead to gastrointestinal discomfort.\\n\\nAnalgesic/caffeine combinations are popular such as the aspirin-caffeine combination or the aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine combinations. Frequent use (daily or skipping just one day in between use for 7–10 days) of any of the above analgesics may, however, lead to medication overuse headache.\\n\\nAnalgesic/sedative combinations are widely used (e.g., analgesic/antihistamine combinations, analgesic/barbiturate combinations such as Fiorinal).\\n\\nMuscle relaxants are typically used for and are helpful with acute post-traumatic TTH rather than ETTH. Opioid medications are not utilized to treat ETTH. Botulinum toxin does not appear to be helpful.\\n\\nChronic \\nClasses of medications involved in treatment of CTTH include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, benzodiazepine (Clonazepam in small evening dose), and muscle relaxants. The most commonly utilized TCA is amitriptyline due to the postulated role in decreasing central sensitization and analgesic relief. Another popular TCA used is Doxepine. SSRIs may also be utilized for management of CTTH. For patients with concurrent muscle spasm and CTTH, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine can be a helpful option.\\n\\nThese medications however, are not effective if concurrent overuse of over the counter medications or other analgesics is occurring. Stopping overuse must occur prior to proceeding with other forms of treatment.\\n\\nManual therapy \\nCurrent evidence for acupuncture is slight. A 2016 systematic review suggests better evidence among those with frequent tension headaches, but concludes that further trials comparing acupuncture with other treatment options are needed.\\n\\nPeople with tension-type headache often use spinal manipulation, soft tissue therapy, and myofascial trigger point treatment. Studies of effectiveness are mixed. A 2006 systematic review found no rigorous evidence supporting manual therapies for tension headache. A 2005 structured review found only weak evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for tension headache, and that it was probably more effective for tension headache than for migraine. A 2004 Cochrane review found that spinal manipulation may be effective for migraine and tension headache, and that spinal manipulation and neck exercises may be effective for cervicogenic headache. Two other systematic reviews published between 2000 and May 2005 did not find conclusive evidence in favor of spinal manipulation. A 2012 systematic review of manual therapy found that hands-on work may reduce both the frequency and the intensity of chronic tension-type headaches. More current literature also appears to be mixed however, CTTH patients may benefit from massage and physiotherapy as suggested by a systemic review examining these modalities via RCTs specifically for this patient population Despite being helpful, the review also makes a point to note that there is no difference in effectiveness long term (6 months) between those CTTH patients utilizing TCAs and physiotherapy. Another systemic review comparing manual therapy to pharmacologic therapy also supports little long term difference in outcome regarding TTH frequency, duration, and intensity.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nAs of 2016 tension headaches affect about 1.89 billion people  and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively). Despite its benign character, tension-type headache, especially in its chronic form, can impart significant disability on patients as well as burden on society at large.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n American Council for Headache Education\\n National Headache Foundation\\n World Headache Alliance\\n\\nHeadaches\",\n",
       "       'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as  reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is a rare condition in which parts of the brain are affected by swelling, usually as a result of an underlying cause. Someone with PRES may experience headache, changes in vision, and seizures, with some developing other neurological symptoms such as confusion or weakness of one or more limbs. The name of the condition includes the word \"posterior\" because it predominantly though not exclusively affects the back of the brain (the parietal and occipital lobes). Common underlying causes are severely elevated blood pressure, kidney failure, severe infections, certain medications, some autoimmune diseases, and pre-eclampsia. The diagnosis is usually made by brain scan (MRI) on which areas of swelling can be identified.\\n\\nThe treatment for PRES is supportive: removal of the cause or causes and treatment of any of the complications, such as anticonvulsants for seizures. PRES may be complicated by intracranial hemorrhage, but this is relatively rare. The majority of people recover fully, although some may experience some residual symptoms. PRES was first described in 1996.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nPRES usually has an acute onset. Most people with PRES experience headaches and seizures; many also experience visual changes, confusion and drowsiness, weakness of the arm and/or leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia), difficulty speaking, or more rarely other neurological symptoms. The visual changes in PRES may include hemianopsia (inability to see the left or right part of the visual field), blurred vision, lack of visual awareness on one side, visual hallucinations, and cortical blindness.\\n\\nSeizures occur in about two thirds of cases. In children this is more common still, at 90%. If seizures occur they may be focal or generalized. A small proportion develops status epilepticus, where seizures are not controlled with simple measures.\\n\\nCauses\\nCauses that may contribute to the development of PRES are: immunosuppression (especially for organ transplantation, e.g. with tacrolimus), severe infection and/or sepsis, chemotherapy, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia. High blood pressure is often present. Similarly, the majority of people with PRES have an impaired kidney function, and 21% are receiving regular hemodialysis. In PRES related to medications, there may be an interval of weeks to months between the initiation of the treatment and the development of PRES. After a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplant) the risk of PRES is approximately 8%, whereas the risk is lower (0.4-6%) after a solid organ transplant.\\n\\nThe following autoimmune conditions have been found to be associated with PRES: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Crohn\\'s disease and neuromyelitis optica (NMO), as well as hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). A number of other associations have also been reported, including some other groups of medications, blood transfusion, elevated calcium levels, decreased magnesium levels, postpartum cerebral angiopathy, and drugs of abuse (cocaine and amphetamine).\\n\\nIt has been suggested that PRES is identical or closely related with hypertensive encephalopathy, the presence of neurological symptoms in those with a hypertensive emergency.\\n\\nMechanism\\nThe precise mechanism is PRES is not fully understood, it is considered to be related to a problem with the blood vessels of the brain. There are several theories as to why these blood vessels may become inappropriately permeable and allow the surrounding brain tissue to become swollen. The \"vasogenic\" theory posits that elevated blood pressure overcomes the normal capability of blood vessels in the brain to maintain a normal cerebral blood flow. The excessive pressure damages the endothelial layer and the blood-brain barrier, leading to swelling (edema). The predilection toward the posterior brain may be explained by the reduced density of sympathetic innervation in the posterior circulation compared to the anterior circulation. The \"vasogenic\" theory seems to explain the almost 50% of cases of PRES where there had been severely elevated blood pressure. It is also called the \"breakthrough\" theory, or the \"hyperperfusion theory\". This theory does not explain the edema in many other cases where the blood pressure has been normal or even low; in fact, the edema tends to be more severe in those without abnormally elevated blood pressure.\\n\\nIn PRES secondary to other causes, the blood vessel damage has been attributed to other mechanisms. The \"cytotoxic\" theory suggests that it is direct cell damage by toxins (usually medications) that precipitates the edema. The \"immunogenic\" theory suggests a role for the immune system (specifically T cells). Some consider the cytotoxic and immunogenic theories together as a single \"toxic\" theory. There appears to be a role of cytokines in causing endothelial dysfunction.\\n\\nFinally, according to the \"neuropeptide/cerebral vasoconstriction\" theory, some specific substances (endothelin 1, thromboxane A2) trigger spasm of the blood vessels with resultant vessel wall damage and edema. The latter hypothesis is supported by the frequent finding of diffuse blood vessel spasms (vasoconstriction) in many people with PRES, and the evidence for decreased perfusion, although the spasm may also be a consequence of the blood vessel damage rather than the cause. Some, therefore, include the vasospasm in the \"toxic\" theory. It is considered likely that these multiple mechanisms all potentially play a role in the development of PRES.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are no formal diagnostic criteria for PRES, but it has been proposed that PRES can be diagnosed if someone has developed acute neurological symptoms (seizure, altered mental state, headache, visual disturbances) together with one or more known risk factors, typical appearance on brain imaging (or normal imaging), and no other alternative diagnosis. Some consider that the abnormalities need to be shown to be reversible. If lumbar puncture is performed this may show increased protein levels but no white blood cells. Computed tomography scanning may be performed in the first instance; this may show low density white matter areas in the posterior lobes.\\n\\nThe diagnosis is typically made with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The findings most characteristic for PRES are symmetrical hyperintensities on T2-weighed imaging in the parietal and occipital lobes; this pattern is present in more than half of all cases. FLAIR sequences can be better at showing these abnormalities. Some specific other rare patterns have been described: the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) watershed pattern, a watershed pattern involving the entire hemisphere (holohemispheric), and a central pattern with vasogenic oedema in the deep white matter, basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and pons. These distinct patterns do not generally correlate with the nature of the symptoms or their severity, although severe edema may suggest a poorer prognosis. If the appearances are not typical, other causes for the symptoms and the imaging abnormalities need to considered before PRES can be diagnosed conclusively. In many cases there is evidence of constriction of the blood vessels (if angiography is performed), suggesting a possible overlap with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Diffusion MRI may be used to identify areas of cytotoxic edema caused by poor blood flow (ischemia) but it is not clear if this prognostically relevant. Abnormal apparent diffusion coefficient is seen in about 20% of cases.\\n\\nIn 10–25% of cases of PRES there is evidence of hemorrhage on neuroimaging. Various types of hemorrhage may occur: hemorrhage into the brain tissue itself (intraparenchymal hemorrhage), sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and microbleeds.\\n\\nTreatment\\nThere is no direct treatment for PRES, other than removing or treating any underlying cause. For instance, immunosuppressive medication may need to be withheld. 40% of all people with PRES are unwell enough to require intensive care unit admission for close observation and treatment of complications. Those with seizures are administered anticonvulsants.\\n\\nIf there is a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure is lowered by 20-30% using continuous infusion of a blood pressure lowering drug with close monitoring. Of the blood pressure lowering agents available, nitrates may need to be avoided as there is a concern that this may aggravate the PRES even while lowering the blood pressure. In PRES secondary to pre-eclampsia, magnesium sulfate may be administered.\\n\\nPrognosis\\nWith adequate treatment, 70-90% of people with PRES make a full recovery within hours to days. 8–17% of people with PRES die, although this is not always a direct consequence of the PRES. Of those who have residual symptoms after PRES, this is attributable largely to hemorrhage. Non-resolution of MRI abnormalities has been linked with poorer outcomes. If PRES was caused by pre-eclampsia the prognosis is better than in PRES due to other causes.\\n\\nFactors that predict poorer prognosis are the person\\'s age, the level of C-reactive protein in the blood (a marker of inflammation), altered mental state at the time of diagnosis, and altered markers of coagulation. People with diabetes may have a worse outcome, and abnormalities in the corpus callosum on MRI have been linked with worse prognosis. Some patterns on electroencephalography (EEG) are also associated with a poorer outcome.\\n\\nAfter an episode of PRES, even when it was associated with seizure activity, only a small proportion of people remains at risk of ongoing seizures and the majority can eventually discontinue anticonvulsant treatment.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nThe incidence (number of cases per year) of PRES is not known, but increasing use of MRI scans has led to increased recognition.\\n\\nHistory\\nPRES was first described in 1996 in a group of 15 patients identified retrospectively in the records of the New England Medical Center in Boston and Hôpital Sainte Anne in Paris. The name was revised in 2000 from \"leukencephalopathy\" to \"encephalopathy\" as the former suggested that it only affects the white matter of the brain, which is not the case.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\nCentral nervous system disorders\\nHypertension\\nSyndromes affecting the nervous system',\n",
       "       'A somatosensory disorder is an impairment of the somatosensory system.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms \\nPeople may experience numbness, prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), or the feeling a limb has \"fallen asleep\" (an indicator of nerve compression), burning, cutting or other sensations.\\n\\nSeizures \\nCertain types of seizures are associated with the somatosensory system. Cortical injury may lead to loss of thermal sensation or the ability to discriminate pain. An aura involving thermal and painful sensations is a phenomenon known to precede the onset of an epileptic seizure or focal seizure. Another type of seizure, called a sensory Jacksonian seizure involves an abnormal, localizable, cutaneous sensation but does not have apparent stimulus. This sensation may progress along a limb or to adjacent cutaneous body areas, reflecting abnormal neuronal firing in the postcentral gyrus where an epileptic discharge is propagated. These episodes in which patients are consciously aware during a seizure have been useful for identifying problems associated with the somatosensory cortex. Patients can describe the nature of the seizure and how they feel during it.\\n\\nMechanism \\nThe absence of proprioception or two-point tactile discrimination on one side of the body suggests injury to the contralateral side of the primary somatosensory cortex. However, depending on the extent of the injury, damage can range in loss of proprioception of an individual limb or the entire body. A deficit known as cortical astereognosis of the receptive type describes an inability to make use of tactile sensory information for identifying objects placed in the hand. For example, if this type of injury effects the hand region in the primary somatosensory cortex for one cerebral hemisphere, a patient with closed eyes cannot perceive the position of the fingers on the contralateral hand and will not be able to identify objects such as keys or a cell phone if they are placed into that hand.\\n\\nDiagnosis \\nEvaluation of any suspected disease of the somatosensory system is included in a neurological examination of the peripheral nervous system. Modern techniques for testing somatosensory function are still quite crude compared to testing motor function. Evaluation of somatosensory stimuli are limited by the patient\\'s interpretation of sensation in response to testing.\\n\\nTactile sensation is tested with a cotton wisp or light touch with a finger. Pain is assessed by pinprick or pinwheel (Wartenberg wheel). A 128\\xa0Hz tuning fork is used for testing vibrations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nSomatosensory system',\n",
       "       \"Dentomandibular sensorimotor dysfunction (DMSD) is a medical condition involving the mandible (lower jaw), upper three cervical (neck) vertebrae, and the surrounding muscle and nerve areas. \\n\\nThere is a concentrated nerve center in this area called the trigeminal nucleus. This major pathway of nerves controls pain signals from the teeth, face, head, and neck, and carries them to the brain. DMSD refers to a condition in which an individual experiences chronic pain or stiffness from these nerve inputs as a result of dental force imbalances.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThere are many symptoms associated with DMSD conditions. The most commonly reported are:\\n\\nHeadache/Migraine\\nChronic daily headache\\nTension-type headache\\nMyofascial pain\\nTinnitus\\nTemporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD)\\nPulpitis\\nPoor airway control\\nSleep/arousal disorder\\nChanges in brain chemistry and neurotransmitter balance\\nBruxism\\nAbfraction\\nTooth fracture/damage\\nUnstable dental arch form\\nRestricted range of motion and postural adaptations\\nClenching with or without torus formation\\nAbnormal tooth wear patterns\\nMalocclusion\\nParafunction\\nDegenerative joint disease\\n\\nThis condition affects all ages and both genders. However, females are more likely to suffer from DMSD. Individuals who have experienced chronic headaches and/or migraines without finding lasting relief through traditional medicine can be assessed for DMSD through a combination of objective tests, evaluations, and a comprehensive discussion of their symptoms, medical history, headache history, pharmacological background, and head health. Research used in sports medicine and rehabilitation allows dentists to address the population with DMSD symptoms.\\n\\nDental foundation\\nThe dental foundation consists of teeth, muscles, and joints in the dentofacial (head and neck) area. The dental foundation is considered to be out of balance when one or more of the following conditions apply:\\n\\nAdvanced aging or disability of the muscles which open the jaw.\\nMovement or noises in the jaw joints which indicate the disks in the neck are moving, deformed, or swollen.\\nTooth wear or breakage.\\nLimited range of motion in the jaw and cervical (neck) spine.\\nPainful or sore head and/or neck muscles with very sensitive spots referred to as trigger points.\\nPain that stems from the trigeminal cervical nucleus.\\nAny lifestyle limitation related to the teeth, muscles, or joints of the head and neck.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nThe protocol for assessment of the condition is typically done in several stages:\\n\\nA physical examination with head health, headache, pharmacological and complete medical histories. Additionally, dental, periodontal, occlusal, orthodontic, and airway examinations are encouraged as part of the initial screening process.\\nNext, a panoramic radiograph (also called a curved surface tomograph) is used to identify or confirm dental conditions which may contribute to painful DMSD symptoms. Computed tomography (CT scans) can also be utilized at this point for further aid in assessment and treatment planning.\\nMuscle palpation is used to evaluate where the individual is experiencing trigger points. These are areas of high sensitivity in the facial, head, and neck muscles. When these areas are pressed, it causes pain either in that muscle (localized pain), or in another area (referred pain). A muscle palpation examination is performed to aid in the discovery of “latent trigger points”, or trigger points which cause no pain unless direct pressure is applied.\\n\\nDigital portion\\n\\nTekscan's T-Scan\\nThis tool is used for digital force analysis to measure the presence and amount of imbalance at closing of the mouth, during closure, and during mastication (chewing). The computer displays the results of how the forces in the mouth spread along the arch, the center of force, the center of force trajectory, and the left/right force balance. This means the dentist can show patients which teeth are generating the most force, and facilitates the dentist’s knowledge of what adjustments need to be made to teeth and soft tissue to create a stable dental foundation.\\n\\nRange-of-motion (ROM) assessment\\nThis test digitally measures an individual’s cervical range of motion from a standing position and displays the results in terms of flexion and extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. Limited cervical range of motion is a disability, and being able to understand what is normal—and where their own mouth, head and neck are during the examination—helps people see how this disability is affecting their condition.\\n\\nThis is also when the amount a person can open their mouth is measured. Along with normal opening movement, the jaw should slide symmetrically from left to right at least 25% of the total mouth opening distance.\\n\\nFinally, during the range of motion assessment, a record of jaw joint vibrations and sounds are made. Normal jaw joints glide without noise or vibrations.\\n\\nDepending on the assessment findings, patients are classified as needing 1 of 4 levels of care (see Table 1: Levels of Dental Headache Care) to treat and manage their pain and balance their dental foundation. Every level has a regimented therapy protocol designed to provide the most effective, long-lasting care for each individual.\\n\\nOnce the type of headache pain and extent of dental foundation imbalance is determined, treatment options are discussed. \\nHistorically, the treatments for headache pain included one or a combination of herbal remedies, stress-reduction exercises, massage, acupuncture, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), narcotic pain relievers, anti-seizure medications, chiropractic adjustments, anti-depressants or sedatives.\\n\\nThe combination of advanced dentistry techniques and sports rehabilitation-derived therapies used in treating dental force imbalances in dental headache care has resulted in a dentist reported 93% success rate in providing patients with real, lasting relief from their DMSD symptoms. The methods used control muscle force and force balance, restore proper function and range of motion, and change the way the brain perceives stimuli, so pain levels, dysfunction, and improper muscle activity \\nreturn to normal. By balancing the muscles, joints, and teeth, and controlling the way the body feels pain in the head and neck \\nareas, long lasting pain relief can be achieved.\\n\\nOnce the individual has had the proper dental adjustments to restore normalcy to the dental foundation, and has been prescribed and fitted for their at-home orthotic (worn in the mouth for the short term, typically only during the 4- to 12-week rehabilitation period) for muscle re-training, the sports rehabilitation-derived components of therapy begin.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nTherapeutic ultrasound\\nThe goal of therapeutic ultrasound treatment is to restore circulation to sore, strained muscles through increased blood flow and heat. Another objective is to break up scar tissue and deep adhesions (areas where connective tissue fibers have formed over muscle) through sound waves. Therapeutic exposure to ultrasound reduces trigger point sensitivity and is considered a useful clinical tool for managing myofascial pain. Moreover, the ultrasound has also been shown to lessen the stiffness and discomfort of trigger points.\\n\\nTranscutaneous electrical stimulation\\nSub-threshold micro-current stimulation reduces muscle spasms and referral pain through a low electrical signal that decreases lactic acid buildup and encourages healthy nerve stimulation. Micro-current electrotherapy is known to significantly aid in increasing mouth opening.\\n\\nLow-level laser (light) therapy\\nLow-level laser therapy, sometimes called light therapy for short, decreases pain and inflammation, accelerates the healing of muscle and joint tissues by 25%-35%, and reconnects the brain stem’s neurological pathways, effectively inhibiting pain. Low-level laser therapy combined with electrical stimulation improves mouth opening in patients diagnosed with TMJ/D. The musculoskeletal system's natural healing ability decreases pain and promotes TMJ stability.\\n\\nManual muscle or trigger-point therapy\\nManual trigger-point therapy, also known as manual muscle therapy, decreases and eliminates pain and tension in the trigger points by breaking up muscle knots and increasing blood flow. This decreases inflammation and pain in the muscles.\\n\\nAs part of their in-office treatment, a dentist-monitored homecare system/deprogrammer and intraoral orthotic device are given to patients for their own personal use on their own time.\\n\\nTable 1: Levels of dental force imbalance and dental headache care\\n\\nPatients will typically need:\\n A rehabilitation orthotic and some occlusal adjustments\\n A rehabilitation orthotic, and some occlusal adjustments\\n In-office treatments, rehabilitation orthotic, a basic at-home care kit, and occlusal adjustments\\n A greater number of in-office treatments, a rehabilitation orthotic, a basic at-home care kit, a micro-current stimulation kit, and occlusal adjustments.\\n\\nSee also\\n Temporomandibular joint disorder\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n  Online edition.\\n\\nPain\\nChronic pain syndromes\\nMusculoskeletal disorders\\nJaw disorders\\nMedical terminology\",\n",

       "       'Ocular neuropathic pain is a spectrum of disorders of ocular pain which are caused by damage or disease affecting the nerves. Ocular neuropathic pain is frequently associated with damaged or dysfunctional corneal nerves, but the condition can also be caused by peripheral or centralized sensitization. The condition shares some characteristics with somatic neuropathic pain in that it is similarly associated with abnormal sensations (dysesthesia) or pain from normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia), but until recent years has been poorly understood by the medical community, and frequently dismissed by ophthalmologists who were not trained to identify neuropathic pain as a source of unexplained eye pain beyond objective findings noted on slit-lamp examination. \\n\\nThis condition is frequently associated with dry eye disease since sensations of dryness and burning in the eye are a common symptom of both neuropathic eye pain and dry eye, but ocular neuropathic pain should be considered as a disease in its own right. Neuropathic pain patients may have little or no signs of aqueous dry eye, and frequently respond poorly to conventional dry eye treatments. Unlike conventional dry eye disease, there may be little or no sign of ocular surface damage, (the condition is sometimes referred to as \"pain without stain\"), however patients may also have symptoms of dry eye but with pain symptoms that are out of proportion to the dry eye presentation.\\n\\nThe experience of painful sensations in this condition can vary widely, reflecting a variety of causal factors such as: types of noxious stimuli causing insult to ocular surface nociceptors, the types of corneal sensory receptors affected, (including cold-sensing thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and polymodal receptors), the extent of the inflammatory responses, and the type or types of disorders and damage affecting the nervous system.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms \\nSymptoms of ocular neuropathic pain can range from devastating, unrelenting eye pain and severe sensitivity to light (photophobia) in the worst cases, to mild hyperalgesia or dysesthesia such as a sensation of dryness, stinging, or foreign body in milder cases. Mild neuropathic pain symptoms can appear similar to clinical symptoms of aqueous dry eye which can impede proper diagnosis. Sensations and levels of pain can vary depending on the source or sources of the maladaptive signals (eg. abnormal axonal regeneration, peripheral sensitization, etc). One or both eyes may be affected, with varying degrees of severity. \\n\\nThe sensation of pain has been described by patients as \"burning eyes\", \"terrible, unrelenting pain\", a feeling of \"a knife in my eye\" or \"paper cuts\". The pain is usually described as being located in and around the eye, but can progress to the surrounding areas of the face and head. A signature characteristic of ocular neuropathic pain is inadequately explained levels of severe, constant pain in relation to little or no sign of ocular surface damage. Providers have reported their patients describing excruciating, consistently high levels of pain, or even requesting surgical removal of the painful eye.\\n\\nCases of severe, refractory pain and related symptoms attributed to this condition have been described in medical publications. The severe and constant nature of the pain, as well as the difficulty in effective pain management are characteristics of severe cases. Oxford Academic described a case of a post-Lasik corneal neuralgia patient whose pain was refractory to years of aggressive ophthalmological and pain management treatments,  and required surgical intervention to manage the constant, debilitating pain. Prior to surgery, the patient reported daily pain which varied from 6 to 10 on a numerical rating scale (where 0 signifies no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain), depending on environmental factors. The pain was described as sharp, non-radiating, felt like paper cuts in both eyes, and the pain had persisted for 7 years prior to successful treatment with an implanted intrathecal pain pump.\\n\\nComorbid conditions \\n\\nA number of comorbid conditions have been identified which may predispose the patient to ocular neuropathic pain, including peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and Sjogren\\'s Syndrome.\\n\\nCauses \\nOcular neuropathic pain is a spectrum of disorders, the various clinical expressions of this disease are believed to reflect the complexity of overlapping networks of interactive pathogenetic cascades. One or more causes may be shown to be present in a single patient through clinical examinations.\\n\\nCorneal sensitization and evaporative hyperalgesia \\n\\nCorneal sensitization and evaporative hyperalgesia occur as a result of trauma and environmental stress, the cornea has the highest density of nociceptors of any tissue in the body, and can become more sensitive to normal environmental stimuli. Predisposing factors to developing neuropathic pain include refractive surgeries (such as LASIK or LASEK) where it can occur as a result of aberrant nerve regeneration, tear dysfunction, blepharoplasty, excessive UV light exposure, chemical injury, and trigeminal zoster.\\n\\nPeripheral injuries and central sensitization \\n\\nPeripheral injuries trigger complex changes in the central nociceptive system which can lead to central sensitization that enhances the sensitivity and responsiveness of the brain regions involved in sensory processing. In some cases, these physiological responses progress to neuropathic centralized pain.\\n\\nTreatments \\nBecause the nerve damage and inflammation often originates in the ocular surface, conventional dry eye treatments including artificial tears are often the first line of treatment. A nonfenestrated scleral lens such as the Boston Ocular Surface Prosthesis (PROSE) can insulate the corneal surface from unwanted stimuli. Gabapentin and other neuropathic pain medications may be used to blunt sensory nerve stimulation or the perception of nerve stimulation.\\n\\nRecent publications have shown that neuro-regenerative therapies such as 20% autologous serum eye drops and topical nerve growth factor, and anti-inflammatory agents that minimize nerve injury and sensitization from uncontrolled inflammation (e.g., corticosteroids) can be effective in patients that have not responded to prior treatments. For severe refractory ocular neuropathic pain cases where conservative treatments have proven ineffective, Intrathecal Targeted Drug Delivery with an implanted intrathecal pain pump has been used to successfully treat pain symptoms\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nDiseases of the eye and adnexa',\n",
       "       'Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), also known as idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEI), is an unrecognized and controversial diagnosis characterized by chronic symptoms attributed to exposure to low levels of commonly used chemicals. Symptoms are typically vague and non-specific. They may include fatigue, headaches, nausea, and dizziness.\\n\\nAlthough these symptoms can be debilitating, MCS is not recognized as an organic, chemical-caused illness by the World Health Organization, American Medical Association, nor any of several other professional medical organizations. Blinded clinical trials show that people with MCS react as often and as strongly to placebos as they do to chemical stimuli; the existence and severity of symptoms is seemingly related to perception that a chemical stimulus is present.\\n\\nCommonly attributed substances include scented products (e.g. perfumes), pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabrics, smoke, petroleum products, and paint fumes.\\n\\nSymptoms \\nSymptoms are typically vague and non-specific, such as fatigue or headaches.  These symptoms, although they can be disabling, are called non-specific because they are not associated with any single specific medical condition.\\n\\nA 2010 review of MCS literature said that the following symptoms, in this order, were the most reported in the condition: headache, fatigue, confusion, depression, shortness of breath, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, memory problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms.\\n\\nSymptoms mainly arise from the autonomic nervous system (such as nausea or dizziness) or have psychiatric or psychological aspects (such as difficulty concentrating).\\n\\nPossible causes \\nVarious different causes for MCS have been hypothesized.\\n\\nThere is a general agreement among most MCS researchers that the cause is not specifically related to sensitivity to chemicals, but this does not preclude the possibility that symptoms are caused by other known or unknown factors. Various health care professionals and government agencies are working on giving those who report the symptoms proper care while searching for a cause.\\n\\nIn 2017, a Canadian government Task Force on Environmental Health said that there had been very little rigorous peer-reviewed research into MCS and almost a complete lack of funding for such research in North America. \"Most recently,\" it said, \"some peer-reviewed clinical research has emerged from centres in Italy, Denmark and Japan suggesting that there are fundamental neurobiologic, metabolic, and genetic susceptibility factors that underlie ES/MCS.\"\\n\\nThe US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that MCS is highly controversial and that there is insufficient scientific evidence to explain the relationship between any of the suggested causes of MCS – it lists \"allergy, dysfunction of the immune system, neurobiological sensitization, and various psychological theories\" as the suggested causes – and its symptoms.\\n\\nImmunological \\nResearchers have studied immunity biomarkers in people with MCS to determine whether MCS could be an autoimmune disorder or allergic response, but the results have been inconclusive. Some people with MCS appear to have excess production of inflammatory cytokines, but this phenomenon is not specific to MCS and overall there is no evidence that low-level chemical exposure causes an immune response.\\n\\nGenetic \\nIt has been hypothesized that there is a heritable genetic trait which pre-disposes people to be hypersensitive to low-level chemical exposure and so develop MCS. To investigate, researchers compared the genetic makeup of people with MCS, to people without. The results were generally inconclusive and contradictory, thus failing to support the hypothesis.\\n\\nGaétan Carrier and colleagues write that the genetic hypothesis appears implausible when the evidence around it is judged by the Bradford Hill criteria.\\n\\nPsychological \\n\\nSeveral mechanisms for a psychological etiology of the condition have been proposed, including theories based on misdiagnoses of an underlying mental illness, stress, or classical conditioning. Many people with MCS also meet the criteria for major depressive disorder or anxiety disorder. Other proposed explanations include somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, or fibromyalgia and brain fog. Through behavioral conditioning, it has been proposed that people with MCS may develop real, but unintentionally psychologically produced, symptoms, such as anticipatory nausea, when they encounter certain odors or other perceived triggers. It has also been proposed in one study that individuals may have a tendency to \"catastrophically misinterpret benign physical symptoms\"  or simply have a disturbingly acute sense of smell. The personality trait absorption, in which individuals are predisposed to becoming deeply immersed in sensory experiences, may be stronger in individuals reporting symptoms of MCS.  In the 1990s, behaviors exhibited by MCS sufferers were hypothesized by some to reflect broader sociological fears about industrial pollution and broader societal trends of technophobia and chemophobia.\\n\\nThese theories have attracted criticism.\\n\\nIn Canada, in 2017, following a three-year government inquiry into environmental illness, it was recommended that a public statement be made by the health department.\\n\\nA 2018 systematic review concluded that the evidence suggests that abnormalities in sensory processing pathways combined with peculiar personality traits best explains this condition.\\n\\nDiagnosis \\nIn practice, diagnosis relies entirely upon the self-reported claim that symptoms are triggered by exposure to various substances.\\n\\nMany other tests have been promoted by various people over the years, including testing of the immune system, porphyrin metabolism, provocation-neutralization testing, autoantibodies, the Epstein–Barr virus, testing for evidence of exposure to pesticides or heavy metals, and challenges involving exposure to chemicals, foods, or inhalants.  None of these tests correlate with MCS symptoms, and none are useful for diagnosing MCS.\\n\\nThe stress and anxiety experienced by people reporting MCS symptoms are significant.  Neuropsychological assessments do not find differences between people reporting MCS symptoms and other people in areas such as verbal learning, memory functioning, or psychomotor performance.  Neuropsychological tests are sensitive but not specific, and they identify differences that may be caused by unrelated medical, neurological, or neuropsychological conditions.\\n\\nAnother major goal for diagnostic work is to identify and treat any other medical conditions the person may have.  People reporting MCS-like symptoms may have other health issues, ranging from common conditions, such as depression or asthma, to less common circumstances, such a documented chemical exposure during a work accident.  These other conditions may or may not have any relationship to MCS symptoms, but they should be diagnosed and treated appropriately, whenever the patient history, physical examination, or routine medical tests indicates their presence.  The differential diagnosis list includes solvent exposure, occupational asthma, and allergies.\\n\\nDefinitions \\nDifferent researchers and proponents use different definitions, which complicates research and can affect diagnosis.  For example, the 1987 definition that requires symptoms to begin suddenly after an identifiable, documented exposure to a chemical, but the 1996 definition by the WHO/ICPS says that the cause can be anything, including other medical conditions or psychological factors.\\n\\nIn 1996, an expert panel at WHO/ICPS was set up to examine MCS. The panel accepted the existence of \"a disease of unclear pathogenesis\", rejected the claim that MCS was caused by chemical exposure, and proposed these three diagnostic requirements for what they re-named idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEI):\\n\\n the disease was acquired (not present from birth) and must produce multiple relapsing symptoms;\\nthe symptoms must be closely related to \"multiple environmental influences, which are well tolerated by the majority of the population\"; and\\nit could not be explained by any other medical condition.\\nIn Japan, MCS is called chemical hypersensitivity or chemical intolerance (化学物質過敏症; kagaku bushitsu kabinsho), and the 1999 Japanese definition requires one or more of four major symptoms – headaches; malaise and fatigue; muscle pain; joint pain – combined with laboratory findings and/or some minor symptoms, such as mental effects or skin conditions.  The defined lab findings are abnormalities in parasympathetic nerves, cerebral cortical dysfunction diagnosed by SPECT testing, visuospatial abnormalities, abnormalities of eye movement, or a positive provocation test.\\n\\nInternational Statistical Classification of Diseases \\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization, is a medical coding system used for medical billing and statistical purposes – not for deciding whether any person is sick, or whether any collection of symptoms constitutes a single disease.  The ICD does not list MCS as a discrete disease.  However, this does not mean that people with MCS-related symptoms cannot be treated or billed for medical services.  For example, the public health service in Germany permits healthcare providers to bill for MCS-related medical services under the ICD-10 code T78.4, which is for idiosyncratic reactions, classified under the heading T78, Unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen, anderenorts nicht klassifiziert (\"adverse reactions, not otherwise specified\").  Being able to get paid for medical services and collect statistics about unspecified, idiosyncratic reactions does not mean that MCS is recognized as a specific disease or that any particular cause has been defined by the German government.  Healthcare providers can also bill for MCS-related services under the ICD-10 codes of F45.0 for somatization disorder.  MCS is named in evidence-based (\"S3\") guidelines for the management of patients with nonspecific, functional, and somatoform physical symptoms.\\n\\nManagement\\nThere is no single proven treatment for MCS. The goal of treatment is to improve quality of life, with fewer distressing symptoms and the ability to maintain employment and social relationships, rather than to produce a permanent cure.\\n\\nA multidisciplinary treatment approach is recommended.  It should take into account the uncommon personality traits often seen in affected individuals and physiological abnormalities in sensory pathways and the limbic system. There is also no scientific consensus on supportive therapies for MCS, \"but the literature agrees on the need for patients with MCS to avoid the specific substances that trigger reactions for them and also on the avoidance of xenobiotics in general, to prevent further sensitization.\"\\n\\nCommon self-care strategies include avoiding exposure to known triggers and emotional self-care.  Healthcare providers can provide useful education on the body\\'s natural ability to eliminate and excrete toxins on its own and support positive self-care efforts.  Avoiding triggers, such as by removing smelly cleaning products from the home, can reduce symptoms and increase the person\\'s sense of being able to reclaim a reasonably normal life.  However, for other people with MCS, their efforts to avoid suspected triggers will backfire, and instead produce harmful emotional side effects that interfere with the overall goal of reducing distress and disability. Treatments that have not been scientifically validated, such as detoxification, have been used by MCS patients. Unproven treatments can be expensive, may cause side effects, and may be counterproductive.\\n\\nEpidemiology \\nPrevalence rates for MCS vary according to the diagnostic criteria used. The condition is reported across industrialized countries and it affects women more than men.\\n\\nIn 2018, the same researchers reported that the prevalence rate of diagnosed MCS had increased by more than 300% and self-reported chemical sensitivity by more than 200% in the previous decade. They found that 12.8% of those surveyed reported medically diagnosed MCS and 25.9% reported having chemical sensitivities.\\n\\nA 2014 study by the Canadian Ministry of Health estimated, based on its survey, that 0.9% of Canadian males and 3.3% of Canadian females had a diagnosis of MCS by a health professional.\\n\\nWhile a 2018 study at the University of Melbourne found that 6.5% of Australian adults reported having a medical diagnosis of MCS and that 18.9 per cent reported having adverse reactions to multiple chemicals. The study also found that for 55.4 per cent of those with MCS, the symptoms triggered by chemical exposures could be disabling.\\n\\nGulf War syndrome\\nSymptoms attributed to Gulf War syndrome are similar to those reported for MCS, including headache, fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, inability to concentrate, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal issues.\\n\\nA population-based, cross-sectional epidemiological study involving American veterans of the Gulf War, non-Gulf War veterans, and non-deployed reservists enlisted both during Gulf War era and outside the Gulf War era concluded the prevalence of MCS-type symptoms in Gulf War veterans was somewhat higher than in non-Gulf War veterans. After adjusting for potentially confounding factors (age, sex, and military training), there was a robust association between individuals with MCS-type symptoms and psychiatric treatment (either therapy or medication) before deployment and, therefore, before any possible deployment-connected chemical exposures.\\n\\nThe odds of reporting MCS or chronic multiple-symptom illness was 3.5 times greater for Gulf War veterans than non-Gulf veterans. Gulf War veterans have an increased rate of being diagnosed with multiple-symptom conditions compared to military personnel deployed to other conflicts.\\n\\nPrognosis \\nAbout half of those who claim to be affected by MCS get better over the course of several years, while about half continue to experience distressing symptoms.\\n\\nHistory \\nMCS was first proposed as a distinct disease by Theron G. Randolph in 1950. In 1965, Randolph founded the Society for Clinical Ecology as an organization to promote his ideas about symptoms reported by his patients. As a consequence of his insistence upon his own, non-standard definition of allergy and his unusual theories about how the immune system and toxins affect people, the ideas he promoted were widely rejected, and clinical ecology emerged as a non-recognized medical specialty.\\n\\nSince the 1950s, many hypotheses have been advanced for the science surrounding multiple chemical sensitivity.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, an association was noted with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome.\\n\\nIn 1994, the AMA, American Lung Association, US EPA and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission published a booklet on indoor air pollution that discusses MCS, among other issues. The booklet further states that a pathogenesis of MCS has not been definitively proven, and that symptoms that have been self-diagnosed by a patient as related to MCS could actually be related to allergies or have a psychological basis, and recommends that physicians should counsel patients seeking relief from their symptoms that they may benefit from consultation with specialists in these fields.\\n\\nIn 1995, an Interagency Workgroup on Multiple Chemical Sensitivity was formed under the supervision of the Environmental Health Policy Committee within the United States Department of Health and Human Services to examine the body of research that had been conducted on MCS to that date. The work group included representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of Energy, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and the National Institutes of Health. The Predecisional Draft document generated by the workgroup in 1998 recommended additional research in the basic epidemiology of MCS, the performance of case-comparison and challenge studies, and the development of a case definition for MCS. However, the workgroup also concluded that it was unlikely that MCS would receive extensive financial resources from federal agencies because of budgetary constraints and the allocation of funds to other, extensively overlapping syndromes with unknown cause, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome. The Environmental Health Policy Committee is currently inactive, and the workgroup document has not been finalized.\\n\\nThe different understandings of MCS over the years have also resulted in different proposals for names.  For example, in 1996 the International Programme on Chemical Safety proposed calling it idiopathic environmental illness, because of their belief that chemical exposure may not the sole cause, while another researcher, whose definition includes people with allergies and acute poisoning, calls it chemical sensitivity.\\n\\nSee also\\n Electromagnetic hypersensitivity\\n Sick building syndrome\\n Sensory processing disorder\\n Sensory processing sensitivity\\n List of questionable diseases\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome at the Merck Manual Professional Edition\\n\\nAlternative diagnoses\\nAilments of unknown cause\\nSensitivities',\n",
       "       'Tabes dorsalis is a late consequence of neurosyphilis, characterized by the slow degeneration (specifically, demyelination) of the neural tracts primarily in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord (nerve root). These patients have lancinating nerve root pain which is aggravated by coughing, and features of sensory ataxia with ocular involvement.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nSigns and symptoms may not appear for decades after the initial infection and include weakness, diminished reflexes, paresthesias (shooting and burning pains, pricking sensations, and formication), hypoesthesias (abnormally diminished sense of touch), tabetic gait (locomotor ataxia), progressive degeneration of the joints, loss of coordination, episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation (including glossodynia), personality changes, urinary incontinence, dementia, deafness, visual impairment, positive Romberg\\'s test, and impaired response to light (Argyll Robertson pupil). The skeletal musculature is hypotonic due to destruction of the sensory limb of the spindle reflex. The deep tendon reflexes are also diminished or absent; for example, the \"knee jerk\" or patellar reflex may be lacking (Westphal\\'s sign).  A complication of tabes dorsalis can be transient neuralgic paroxysmal pain affecting the eyes and the ophthalmic areas, previously called \"Pel\\'s crises\" after Dutch physician P.K. Pel. Now more commonly called \"tabetic ocular crises\", an attack is characterized by sudden, intense eye pain, tearing of the eyes and sensitivity to light.\\n\\n\"Tabes dorsalgia\" is a related lancinating back pain.\\n\\n\"Tabetic gait\" is a characteristic ataxic gait of untreated syphilis where the person\\'s feet slap the ground as they strike the floor due to loss of proprioception. In daylight the person can avoid some unsteadiness by watching their own feet.\\n\\nCause\\nTabes dorsalis is caused by demyelination by advanced syphilis infection (tertiary syphilis), when the primary infection by the causative spirochete bacterium, Treponema pallidum, is left untreated for an extended period of time (past the point of blood infection by the organism). The spirochete invades large myelinated fibers, leading to the involvement of the dorsal column medial leminiscus pathway rather than the spinothalamic tract.\\n\\nTreatment \\nIntravenously administered penicillin is the treatment of choice. Associated pain can be treated with opiates, valproate, or carbamazepine. Those with tabes dorsalis may also require physical therapy and occupational therapy to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with syphilis is important.\\n\\nPrognosis \\nLeft untreated, tabes dorsalis can lead to paralysis, dementia, and blindness. Existing nerve damage cannot be reversed.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nThe disease is more frequent in males than in females. Onset is commonly during mid-life. The incidence of tabes dorsalis is rising, in part due to co-associated HIV infection.\\n\\nHistory\\nAlthough there were earlier clinical accounts of this disease, and descriptions and illustrations of the posterior columns of the spinal cord, it was the Berlin neurologist Romberg whose account became the classical textbook description, first published in German and later translated into English.\\n\\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, completed his doctorate on tabes dorsalis in 1885.\\n\\nNotable patients\\n German storywriter E.T.A. Hoffmann appears to have suffered and died from tabes dorsalis.\\n The French novelist Alphonse Daudet kept a journal of the pain he experienced from this condition which was posthumously published as La Doulou (1930) and translated into English as In the Land of Pain (2002) by Julian Barnes.\\n Poet Charles Baudelaire contracted syphilis in 1839 and resorted to opium to help alleviate the pain of tabes dorsalis ascending his spine.\\n Painter Édouard Manet died of syphilis complications, including tabes dorsalis, in 1883, aged 51.\\n Boxer Charley Mitchell\\n Meyer Nudelman, the father of author and doctor Sherwin Nuland, who described his father\\'s affliction extensively in his book Lost in America; A Journey with my Father (2003).\\n\\nSee also \\n General paresis of the insane\\n :Category:Deaths from tabes dorsalis\\n\\nReferences \\n \\n \\'An Essay Upon the Vasomotor Changes in Tabes Dorsalis\\' by Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\nPain\\nHistopathology\\nNeurodegenerative disorders\\nSyphilis',\n",
       "       \"Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome. It is characterized by acute paralysis and loss of reflexes without sensory loss. Pathologically, there is motor axonal degeneration with antibody-mediated attacks of motor nerves and nodes of Ranvier.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nCauses \\n\\nA link to Campylobacter jejuni was suspected when a young girl was admitted to Second Teaching Hospital. She had become ill after feeding the family chickens. She developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Investigators discovered that several of the chickens in the home displayed similar symptoms and C. jejuni was found in their droppings. Several of the paralysis patients were found to have antibodies to C. jejuni and anti-GD1a antibodies, suggesting a link between the pathogen and the disease. In 2015, Zika virus was linked to AMAN.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nThe syndrome typically presents as a progressive flaccid symmetric paralysis with areflexia, often causing respiratory failure.  Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. Pathologically, it is a noninflammatory axonopathy without demyelination. Antibodies attack the coating of the motor neurons without causing inflammation or loss of myelin. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nHistory \\nAMAN, also known as Chinese Paralytic Syndrome, was first described by a group of Johns Hopkins University and University of Pennsylvania neurologists in collaboration with neurologists from the Second Teaching Hospital of Hebei Medical School and Beijing Children's Hospital. In 1991, Guy Mckhann, Jack Griffin, Dave Cornblath and Tony Ho from Johns Hopkins University and Arthur Asbury from University of Pennsylvania visited China to study a mysterious epidemic of paralytic syndrome occurring in northern China. Every summer, hundreds of children from rural China developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure.  Hospitals were overwhelmed with number of cases and often ran out of ventilators and hospital beds.  Examination of these children showed that many of them had acute flaccid paralysis and areflexia but with little or no sensory loss. Electrophysiological testing of these children showed motor axonal loss with occasional conduction block with a lack of demyelinating features and normal sensory potentials. In contrast, the common form of Guillain–Barré syndrome in the West often presents with sensory loss and demyelination on electrophysiology testing and is more common in adults. Later, several autopsies confirmed the focus of the immune attack was at the motor axolemma especially around the nodes of Ranvier.  These cases showed deposition of antibody and complement along the motor axolemma and associated macrophage infiltration.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\nNeurological disorders\\nSyndromes affecting the nervous system\",\n",
       "       'Vestibular migraine (VM) is vertigo with migraine, either as a symptom of migraine or as a related  neurological disorder.\\n\\nA 2010 report from the University of British Columbia published in the journal Headache said that Migraine associated vertigo\\' is emerging as a popular diagnosis for patients with recurrent vertigo\" but, \"in contrast to basilar artery migraine, is neither clinically nor biologically plausible as a migraine variant.\" Epidemiological studies leave no doubt that there is a strong link between vertigo and migraine.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms \\nVertigo is a medically recognized term for the symptom of a vestibular system disturbance.  It may include a feeling of rotation or illusory sensations of motion or both.  The general term dizziness is used by nonmedical people for those symptoms but often refers to a feeling of light-headedness, giddiness, drowsiness, or faintness, all of which must be differentiated from true vertigo, since the latter symptoms might have other causes.\\n\\nMotion sickness occurs more frequently in migraine patients (30–50% more than in controls). Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is an example of migraine-associated vertigo in which headache does not often occur. Basilar artery migraine  (BAM) consists of two or more symptoms (vertigo, tinnitus, decreased hearing, ataxia, dysarthria, visual symptoms in both hemifields or both eyes, diplopia, bilateral paresthesias, paresis, decreased consciousness and/or loss of consciousness) followed by throbbing headache. Auditory symptoms are rare.  However, a study showed a fluctuating low-tone sensorineural hearing loss in more than 50% of patients with BAM with a noticeable change in hearing just before the onset of a migraine headache. The attacks of vertigo are usually concurrent with a headache and the family history is usually positive. The diagnostician must rule out: TIAs, and paroxysmal vestibular disorder accompanied by headache.\\n\\nThere is also a familial vestibulopathy, familial benign recurrent vertigo (fBRV), where episodes of vertigo occur with or without a migraine headache. Testing may show profound vestibular loss. The syndrome responds to acetazolamide. Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) has been linked to mutations in the calcium channel gene. (Ophoff et al. 1966 cf. Lempert et al.)\\n\\nPathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of MAV is not completely understood; both central and peripheral defects have been observed.\\n\\nDiagnosis \\nBy the Consensus document of the Barány Society and the International Headache Society on the diagnostic criteria of vestibular migraine, the diagnostic criteria of vestibular migraine are:\\n\\nThe diagnostic criteria of probable vestibular migraine are:\\n\\nClassification \\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo Migraine is commonly associated with BPPV, the most common vestibular disorder in patients presenting with dizziness. The two may be linked by genetic factors or by vascular damage to the labyrinth.\\nMénière\\'s disease There is an increased prevalence of migraine in patients with Ménière\\'s disease and migraine leads to a greater susceptibility of developing Ménière’s disease. But they can be distinguished. Ménière\\'s disease may go on for days or even years, while migraines typically do not last longer than 24 hours.\\nMotion sickness More prevalent in patients with migraine.\\nPsychiatric syndromes Dizziness and spinning vertigo are the second most common symptom of panic attacks, and they can also present as a symptom of major depression. Migraine is a risk factor for developing major depression and panic disorder and vice versa.\\n\\nTreatment \\nTreatment of migraine-associated vertigo is the same as the treatment for migraine in general. There is not enough evidence to indicate which medications are most effective for preventing vestibular migraine.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nThe prevalence of migraine and vertigo is 1.6 times higher in 200 dizziness clinic patients than in 200 age- and sex-matched controls from an orthopaedic clinic.  Among the patients with unclassified or idiopathic vertigo, the prevalence of migraine was shown to be elevated. In another study, migraine patients reported 2.5 times more vertigo and also 2.5 more dizzy spells during headache-free periods than the controls.\\n\\nMAV may occur at any age with a female:male ratio of between 1.5 and 5:1.  Familial occurrence is not uncommon.  In most patients, migraine headaches begin earlier in life than MAV with years of headache-free periods before MAV manifests.\\n\\nIn a diary study, the 1-month prevalence of MAV was 16%, frequency of MAV was higher and duration longer on days with headache, and MAV was a risk factor for co-morbid anxiety.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n eMedicine article\\n\\nNeurological disorders',\n",
       "       \"Autonomic neuropathy (AN or AAN) is a form of polyneuropathy that affects the non-voluntary, non-sensory nervous system (i.e., the autonomic nervous system), affecting mostly the internal organs such as the bladder muscles, the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, and the genital organs. These nerves are not under a person's conscious control and function automatically. Autonomic nerve fibers form large collections in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis outside the spinal cord. They have connections with the spinal cord and ultimately the brain, however. Most commonly autonomic neuropathy is seen in persons with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2. In most—but not all—cases, autonomic neuropathy occurs alongside other forms of neuropathy, such as sensory neuropathy.\\n\\nAutonomic neuropathy is one cause of malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (referred to as dysautonomia), but not the only one; some conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord also may cause autonomic dysfunction, such as multiple system atrophy, and therefore, may cause similar symptoms to autonomic neuropathy.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms \\nThe signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include the following:\\n Urinary bladder conditions: urinary incontinence or urinary retention which happens due to the uncoordinated contraction of the bladder. Neurogenic bladder is a broad term used to describe this dysfunction.\\n Gastrointestinal tract: dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, diarrhea, constipation\\n Cardiovascular system:  disturbances of heart rate (tachycardia, bradycardia), orthostatic hypotension, inadequate increase of heart rate on exertion\\n Respiratory system: impairments in the signals associated with regulation of breathing and gas exchange (central sleep apnea, hypopnea, bradypnea).\\n Nervous system: pupillary defect, exaggerated hippus, dizziness or lightheadedness.\\n Other areas: hypoglycemia unawareness, genital impotence, sweat disturbances, sicca (dryness).\\n Absence of signs of cerebellar dysfunction or parkinsonian symptoms as the presence of either would indicate the more serious disease of multiple system atrophy.\\n\\nCauses \\nMany health conditions can cause autonomic neuropathy. Some common causes of autonomic neuropathy include:\\n Diabetes, which is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy, can gradually cause nerve damage throughout the body.\\n Injury to nerves caused by surgery or radiation to the neck.\\n Treatment with certain medications, including some drugs used in cancer chemotherapy.\\n Abnormal protein buildup in organs (amyloidosis), which affects the organs and the nervous system.\\n Neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and “Parkinson’s Plus diseases” including multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia, and multiple sclerosis\\n  Autonomic neuropathy may also be caused by an abnormal attack by the immune system (autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy), sometimes as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome which can occur even when cancer has not yet been diagnosed.\\n Certain infectious diseases. Some viruses and bacteria, such as botulism, Lyme disease and HIV, can cause autonomic neuropathy.\\n Inherited disorders. Certain hereditary disorders can cause autonomic neuropathy.\\n Autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks and damages parts of the body, including the nerves. Examples include Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Guillain–Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disease that happens rapidly and can affect autonomic nerves.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nNeurogenic Bladder \\nDepending on the symptoms and severity of the dysfunction, the doctor might suggest one of the following treatments\\n\\n Behavioral changes: such as reducing water intake, kegel exercises, biofeedback training\\n Clean intermittent catheterization: insertion of a foley catheter to remove the urine every few hours and prevent retention, done in a sterile manner. \\n Pharmacological therapy, which includes anticholinergic drugs which reduce the contraction of the bladder\\n Botox injections into the bladder\\n Surgical treatment: Urinary diversion, Artificial Urinary Sphincter, Urethral sling, or insertion of electrical devices adjacent to the bladder to stimulate its contraction.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\nPeripheral nervous system disorders\",\n",
       "       'Torticollis, also known as wry neck, is a dystonic condition defined by an abnormal, asymmetrical head or neck position, which may be due to a variety of causes. The term torticollis is derived from the Latin words tortus for twisted and collum for neck.\\n\\nThe most common case has no obvious cause, and the pain and difficulty with turning the head usually goes away after a few days, even without treatment in adults.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nTorticollis is a fixed or dynamic tilt, rotation, with flexion or extension of the head and/or neck.\\nThe type of torticollis can be described depending on the positions of the head and neck.\\n laterocollis : the head is tipped toward the shoulder\\n rotational torticollis : the head rotates along the longitudinal  axis\\n anterocollis : forward flexion of the head and neck\\n retrocollis : hyperextension of head and neck backward\\nA combination of these movements may often be observed. Torticollis can be a disorder in itself as well as a symptom in other conditions.\\n\\nOther symptoms include:\\n Neck pain\\n Occasional formation of a mass\\n Thickened or tight sternocleidomastoid muscle\\n Tenderness on the cervical spine\\n Tremor in head\\n Unequal shoulder heights\\n Decreased neck movement\\n\\nCauses\\nA multitude of conditions may lead to the development of torticollis including: muscular fibrosis, congenital spine abnormalities, or toxic or traumatic brain injury.\\nA rough categorization discerns between congenital torticollis and acquired torticollis.\\n\\nOther categories include:\\n Osseous\\n Traumatic\\n CNS/PNS\\n Ocular\\n Non-muscular soft tissue\\n Spasmodic\\n Drug induced\\n Oral ties (lip and tongue ties)\\n\\nCongenital muscular torticollis\\nThe congenital muscular torticollis is the most common torticollis which is present at birth. The cause of congenital muscular torticollis is unclear. Birth trauma or intrauterine malposition is considered to be the cause of damage to the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck. Other alterations to the muscle tissue arise from repetitive microtrauma within the womb or a sudden change in the calcium concentration in the body which causes a prolonged period of muscle contraction.\\n\\nAny of these mechanisms can result in a shortening or excessive contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which curtails its range of motion in both rotation and lateral bending. The head typically is tilted in lateral bending toward the affected muscle and rotated toward the opposite side. In other words,  the head itself is tilted in the direction towards the shortened muscle with the chin tilted in the opposite direction.\\n\\nCongenital Torticollis is presented at 1–4 weeks of age, and a hard mass usually develops. It is normally diagnosed using ultrasonography and a colour histogram or clinically through evaluating the infant\\'s passive cervical range of motion.\\n\\nCongenital torticollis constitutes the majority of cases seen in clinical practice. The reported incidence of congenital torticollis is 0.3-2.0%. Sometimes a mass, such as a sternocleidomastoid tumor, is noted in the affected muscle.  Torticollis does not resolve on its own and may result in plagiocephaly.\\n\\nAcquired torticollis\\nNoncongenital muscular torticollis may result from scarring or disease of cervical vertebrae, adenitis, tonsillitis, rheumatism, enlarged cervical glands, retropharyngeal abscess, or cerebellar tumors. It may be spasmodic (clonic) or permanent (tonic). The latter type may be due to Pott\\'s Disease (tuberculosis of the spine).\\n A self-limiting spontaneously occurring form of torticollis with one or more painful neck muscles is by far the most common (\\'stiff neck\\') and will pass spontaneously in 1–4 weeks. Usually the sternocleidomastoid muscle or the trapezius muscle is involved. Sometimes draughts, colds, or unusual postures are implicated; however, in many cases, no clear cause is found. These episodes are commonly seen by physicians.\\nMost commonly this self-limiting form relates to an untreated dental occlusal dysfunction, which is brought on by clenching and grinding the teeth during sleep. Once the occlusion is treated it will completely resolve. Treatment is accomplished with an occlusal appliance, and equilibration of the dentition.\\n Tumors of the skull base (posterior fossa tumors) can compress the nerve supply to the neck and cause torticollis, and these problems must be treated surgically.\\n Infections in the posterior pharynx can irritate the nerves supplying the neck muscles and cause torticollis, and these infections may be treated with antibiotics if they are not too severe, but could require surgical debridement in intractable cases.\\n Ear infections and surgical removal of the adenoids can cause an entity known as Grisel\\'s syndrome, a subluxation of the upper cervical joints, mostly the atlantoaxial joint, due to inflammatory laxity of the ligaments caused by an infection.\\n The use of certain drugs, such as antipsychotics, can cause torticollis.\\n Antiemetics - Neuroleptic Class - Phenothiazines\\n There are many other rare causes of torticollis.  A very rare cause of acquired torticollis is fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), the hallmark of which is malformed great toes.\\n\\nSpasmodic torticollis\\n Torticollis with recurrent, but transient contraction of the muscles of the neck and especially of the sternocleidomastoid, is called spasmodic torticollis. Synonyms are \"intermittent torticollis\", \"cervical dystonia\" or \"idiopathic cervical dystonia\", depending on cause.\\n\\nTrochlear torticollis \\n\\nTorticollis may be unrelated to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, instead caused by damage to the trochlear nerve (fourth cranial nerve), which supplies the superior oblique muscle of the eye. The superior oblique muscle is involved in depression, abduction, and intorsion of the eye. When the trochlear nerve is damaged, the eye is extorted because the superior oblique is not functioning. The affected person will have vision problems unless they turn their head away from the side that is affected, causing intorsion of the eye and balancing out the extorsion of the eye. This can be diagnosed by the Bielchowsky test, also called the head-tilt test, where the head is turned to the affected side. A positive test occurs when the affected eye elevates, seeming to float up.\\n\\nAnatomy \\nThe underlying anatomical distortion causing torticollis is a shortened sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is the muscle of the neck that originates at the sternum and clavicle and inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone on the same side. There are two sternocleidomastoid muscles in the human body and when they both contract, the neck is flexed. The main blood supply for these muscles come from the occipital artery, superior thyroid artery, transverse scapular artery and transverse cervical artery. The main innervation to these muscles is from cranial nerve XI (the accessory nerve) but the second, third and fourth cervical nerves are also involved. Pathologies in these blood and nerve supplies can lead to torticollis.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nEvaluation of a child with torticollis begins with history taking to determine circumstances surrounding birth and any possibility of trauma or associated symptoms. Physical examination reveals decreased rotation and bending to the side opposite from the affected muscle. Some say that congenital cases more often involve the right side, but there is not complete agreement about this in published studies. Evaluation should include a thorough neurologic examination, and the possibility of associated conditions such as developmental dysplasia of the hip and clubfoot should be examined.  Radiographs of the cervical spine should be obtained to rule out obvious bony abnormality, and MRI should be considered if there is concern about structural problems or other conditions.\\n\\nUltrasonography can be used to visualize muscle tissue, with a colour histogram generated to determine cross-sectional area and thickness of the muscle.\\n\\nEvaluation by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist should be considered in children to ensure that the torticollis is not caused by vision problems (IV cranial nerve palsy, nystagmus-associated \"null position,\" etc.).\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis for torticollis includes\\n Cranial nerve IV palsy\\n Spasmus nutans\\n Sandifer syndrome\\n Myasthenia gravis\\n Cerebrospinal fluid leak\\n\\nCervical dystonia appearing in adulthood has been believed to be idiopathic in nature, as specific imaging techniques most often find no specific cause.\\n\\nTreatment \\nInitially, the condition is treated with physical therapies, such as stretching to release tightness, strengthening exercises to improve muscular balance, and handling to stimulate symmetry. A TOT collar is sometimes applied. Early initiation of treatment is very important for full recovery and to decrease chance of relapse.\\n\\nPhysical therapy \\nPhysical therapy is an option for treating torticollis in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner. In the children above 1 year of age, surgical release of the tight sternocleidomastoid muscle is indicated along with aggressive therapy and appropriate splinting. Occupational therapy rehabilitation in Congenital muscular torticollis concentrates on observation, orthosis, gentle stretching, myofascial release techniques, parents’ counseling-training, and home exercise program. While outpatient infant physiotherapy is effective, home therapy performed by a parent or guardian is just as effective in reversing the effects of congenital torticollis. It is important for physical therapists to educate parents on the importance of their role in the treatment and to create a home treatment plan together with them for the best results for their child. Five components have been recognized as the \"first choice intervention\" in PT for treatment of torticollis and include neck passive range of motion, neck and trunk active range of motion, development of symmetrical movement, environmental adaptations, and caregiver education. In therapy, parents or guardians should expect their child to be provided with these important components, explained in detail below. Lateral neck flexion and overall range of motion can be regained quicker in newborns when parents conduct physical therapy exercises several times a day.\\n\\nPhysical therapists should teach parents and guardians to perform the following exercises:\\n Stretching the neck and trunk muscles actively. Parents can help promote this stretching at home with infant positioning. For example, prone positioning will encourage the child to lift their chin off the ground, thereby strengthening their bilateral neck and spine extensor muscles, and stretching their neck flexor muscles. Active rotation exercises in supine, sitting or prone position by using toys, lights and sounds to attract infant\\'s attention to turn neck and look toward the non-affected side.\\n Stretching the muscle in a prone position passively. Passive stretching is manual, and does not include infant involvement. Two people can be involved in these stretches, one person stabilizing the infant while the other holds the head and slowly brings it through the available range of motion. Passive stretching should not be painful to the child, and should be stopped if the child resists. Also, discontinue the stretch if changes in breathing or circulation are seen or felt.\\n Stretching the muscle in a lateral position supported by a pillow (have infant lie on the side with the neck supported by pillow). Affected side should be against the pillow to deviate the neck towards the non-affected side.\\n Environmental adaptations can control posture in strollers, car seats  and swings (using U-shaped neck pillow or blankets to hold neck in neutral position)\\n Passive cervical rotation (much like stretching when being supported by a pillow, have affected side down)\\n Position infant in the crib with affected side by the wall so they must turn to the non-affected side to face out\\n\\nPhysical therapists often encourage parents and caregivers of children with torticollis to modify the environment to improve neck movements and position. Modifications may include:\\n Adding neck supports to the car seat to attain optimal neck alignment\\n Reducing time spent in a single position\\n Using toys to encourage the child to look in the direction of limited neck movement\\n Alternating sides when bottle or breastfeeding\\n Encouraging prone playtime (tummy time). Although the Back to Sleep campaign promotes infants sleeping on their backs to avoid sudden infant death syndrome during sleep, parents should still ensure that their infants spend some waking hours on their stomachs.\\n\\nMicrocurrent therapy \\nA Korean study has recently introduced an additional treatment called microcurrent therapy that may be effective in treating congenital torticollis. For this therapy to be effective the children should be under three months of age and have torticollis involving the entire sternocleidomastoid muscle with a palpable mass and a muscle thickness over 10\\xa0mm. Microcurrent therapy sends minute electrical signals into tissue to restore the normal frequencies in cells. Microcurrent therapy is completely painless and children can only feel the probe from the machine on their skin.\\n\\nMicrocurrent therapy is thought to increase ATP and protein synthesis as well as enhance blood flow, reduce muscle spasms and decrease pain along with inflammation. It should be used in addition to regular stretching exercises and ultrasound diathermy. Ultrasound diathermy generates heat deep within body tissues to help with contractures, pain and muscle spasms as well as decrease inflammation. This combination of treatments shows remarkable outcomes in the duration of time children are kept in rehabilitation programs: Micocurrent therapy can cut the length of a rehabilitation program almost in half with a full recovery seen after 2.6 months.\\n\\nAbout 5–10% of cases fail to respond to stretching and require surgical release of the muscle.\\n\\nSurgery \\nSurgical release involves the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle being dissected free. This surgery can be minimally invasive and done laparoscopically. Usually surgery is performed on those who are over 12 months old. The surgery is for those who do not respond to physical therapy or botulinum toxin injection or have a very fibrotic sternocleidomastoid muscle. After surgery the child will be required to wear a soft neck collar (also called a Callot\\'s cast). There will be an intense physiotherapy program for 3–4 months as well as strengthening exercises for the neck muscles.\\n\\nOther treatments include:\\n Rest and analgesics for acute cases\\n Diazepam or other muscle relaxants\\n Botulinum toxin\\n Encouraging active movements for children 6–8 months of age\\n Ultrasound diathermy\\n\\nPrognosis \\nStudies and evidence from clinical practice show that 85–90% of cases of congenital torticollis are resolved with conservative treatment such as physical therapy. Earlier intervention is shown to be more effective and faster than later treatments. More than 98% of infants with torticollis treated before 1 month of age recover by 2.5 months of age. Infants between 1 and 6 months usually require about 6 months of treatment. After that point, therapy will take closer to 9 months, and it is less likely that the torticollis will be fully resolved. It is possible that torticollis will resolve spontaneously, but chance of relapse is possible. For this reason, infants should be reassessed by their physical therapist or other provider 3–12 months after their symptoms have resolved.\\n\\nOther animals\\n\\nIn veterinary literature usually only the lateral bend of head and neck is termed torticollis, whereas the analogon to the rotatory torticollis in humans is called a head tilt.\\nThe most frequently encountered form of torticollis in domestic pets is the head tilt, but occasionally a lateral bend of the head and neck to one side is encountered.\\n\\nHead tilt\\nCauses for a head tilt in domestic animals are either diseases of the central or peripheral vestibular system or relieving posture due to neck pain.\\nKnown causes for head tilt in domestic animals include:\\n Encephalitozoon cuniculi (or E. cuniculi) infection in rabbits\\n Inner ear infection\\n Hypothyroidism in dogs\\n Disease of the VIIIth cranial nerve the N. Vestibulocochlearis through trauma, infection, inflammation or neoplasia\\n Disease of the brain stem through either stroke, trauma or neoplasia\\n Damage to the vestibular organ due to toxicity, inflammation or impaired blood supply\\n Geriatric vestibular syndrome in dogs\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n Head Tilt: Causes and Treatment\\n\\nAilments of unknown cause\\nDeforming dorsopathies\\nRabbit diseases\\nSymptoms',\n",
       "       'Post-polio syndrome (PPS, poliomyelitis sequelae) is a group of latent symptoms of poliomyelitis (polio), occurring at about a 25–40% rate (latest data greater than 80%). These symptoms are caused by the damaging effects of the viral infection on the nervous system. Symptoms typically occur 15 to 30 years  after an initial acute paralytic attack. Symptoms include decreasing muscular function or acute weakness with pain and fatigue. The same symptoms may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio (NPP) infection.\\n\\nThe precise mechanism that causes PPS is unknown. It shares many features with chronic fatigue syndrome, but unlike that disorder it tends to be progressive and can cause loss of muscle strength. Treatment is primarily limited to adequate rest, conservation of available energy, and supportive measures, such as leg braces and energy-saving devices such as powered wheelchairs, analgesia (pain relief), and sleep aids.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nAfter a period of prolonged stability, individuals who had been infected and recovered from polio begin to experience new signs and symptoms, characterised by muscular atrophy (decreased muscle mass), weakness, pain, and fatigue in limbs that were originally affected or in limbs that did not seem to have been affected at the time of the initial polio illness. PPS is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities. Most patients become aware of their decreased capacity to carry out daily routines due to significant changes in mobility and decreasing upper limb function and lung capability. Fatigue is often the most disabling symptom; even slight exertion often produces disabling fatigue and can also intensify other symptoms. Problems breathing or swallowing, sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea, and decreased tolerance for cold temperatures are other notable symptoms.\\n\\nIncreased activity during healthy years between the original infection and onset of PPS can amplify the symptoms. Thus, contracting polio at a young age can result in particularly disabling PPS symptoms.\\n\\nA possible early occurring and long-lasting sign is a slight jitter exhibited in handwriting.\\n\\nMechanism\\nNumerous theories have been proposed to explain post-polio syndrome. Despite this, no absolutely defined causes of PPS are known. The most widely accepted theory of the mechanism behind the disorder is \"neural fatigue\". A motor unit is a nerve cell (or neuron) and the muscle fibers it activates. Poliovirus attacks specific neurons in the brainstem and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, generally resulting in the death of a substantial fraction of the motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles. In an effort to compensate for the loss of these neurons, surviving motor neurons sprout new nerve terminals to the orphaned muscle fibers. The result is some recovery of movement and the development of enlarged motor units.\\n\\nThe neural fatigue theory proposes that the enlargement of the motor neuron fibers places added metabolic stress on the nerve cell body to nourish the additional fibers. After years of use, this stress may be more than the neuron can handle, leading to the gradual deterioration of the sprouted fibers, and eventually, the neuron itself. This causes muscle weakness and paralysis. Restoration of nerve function may occur in some fibers a second time, but eventually, nerve terminals malfunction and permanent weakness occurs.  When these neurons no longer carry on sprouting, fatigue occurs due to the increasing metabolic demand of the nervous system. The normal aging process also may play a role. Denervation and reinnervation are going on, but the reinnervation process has an upper limit where the reinnervation cannot compensate for the ongoing denervation, and loss of motor units takes place. What disturbs the denervation-reinnervation equilibrium and causes peripheral denervation, though, is still unclear. With age, most people experience a decrease in the number of spinal motor neurons. Because polio survivors have already lost a considerable number of motor neurons, further age-related loss of neurons may contribute substantially to new muscle weakness. The overuse and underuse of muscles also may contribute to muscle weakness.\\n\\nAnother theory is that people who have recovered from polio lose remaining healthy neurons at a faster rate than normal. However, little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally,  the initial polio infection is thought to  cause an autoimmune reaction, in which the body\\'s immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of PPS can be difficult, since the symptoms are hard to separate from complications due to the original polio infection, and from the normal infirmities of aging. No laboratory test for post-polio syndrome is known, nor are any other specific diagnostic criteria. Three important criteria are recognized, including previous diagnosis of polio, long interval after recovery, and  gradual onset of weakness.\\n\\nIn general, PPS is a diagnosis of exclusion whereby other possible causes of the symptoms are eliminated. Neurological examination aided by other laboratory studies can help to determine what component of a neuromuscular deficit occurred with polio and what components are new and to exclude all other possible diagnoses. Objective assessment of muscle strength in PPS patients may not be easy. Changes in muscle strength are determined in specific muscle groups using various muscle scales that quantify] strength, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. magnetic resonance imaging, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies, muscle biopsies, or spinal fluid analysis may also be useful in establishing a PPS diagnosis.\\n\\nManagement\\nPPS treatment concerns comfort (relieving pain via analgesics) and rest (via use of mechanisms to make life easier, such as a powered wheelchair) and is generally of palliative care. No reversive therapies are known. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom. Energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such can be achieved by lifestyle changes, such as additional (daytime) sleep, reducing workload, and weight loss for obesity. Some require lower-limb orthotics to reduce energy usage.\\n\\nMedications for fatigue, such as amantadine and pyridostigmine, are ineffective in the management of PPS. Muscle strength and endurance training are more important in managing the symptoms of PPS than the ability to perform enduring aerobic activity. Management should focus on treatments such as hydrotherapy and developing other routines that encourage strength, but do not affect fatigue levels. A recent trend toward use of intravenous immunoglobulin, which had yielded promising albeit modest results, but  proves insufficient to recommend as a treatment.\\n\\nPPS increasingly stresses the musculoskeletal system from progressive muscular atrophy. In a review of 539 PPS patients, 80% reported pain in muscles and joints and 87% had fatigue. Joint instability can cause appreciable pain and should be adequately treated with painkillers. Directed activity, such as decreasing mechanical stress with braces and adaptive equipment, is recommended.\\n\\nBecause PPS can fatigue facial muscles, as well as cause dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking) or aphonia (inability to produce speech), persons may become malnourished from difficulty eating. Compensatory routines can help relieve these symptoms, such as eating smaller portions at a time and sitting down whilst eating. PPS with respiratory involvement requires exceptional therapy management, such as breathing exercises and chest percussion to expel secretions (clearing of the lungs) on a periodic basis (monitored via stethoscope). Failure to properly assess PPS with respiratory involvement can increase the risk of overlooking an aspiration pneumonia (a life-threatening infection of the lower respiratory tract, especially so if not caught early on). Severe cases may require permanent ventilation or tracheostomy. Sleep apnoea may also occur. Other management strategies that show improvement include smoking cessation, treatment of other respiratory diseases, and vaccination against respiratory infections such as influenza.\\n\\nPrognosis\\nIn general, PPS is not life-threatening. The major exception are patients left with severe residual respiratory difficulties, who may experience new severe respiratory impairment. Compared to control populations, PPS patients lack any elevation of antibodies against the poliovirus, and because no poliovirus is excreted in the feces, it is not considered a recurrence of the original polio. Further,  no evidence has shown that the poliovirus can cause a persistent infection in humans. PPS has been confused with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which progressively weakens muscles. PPS patients do not have an elevated risk of ALS.\\n\\nNo sufficient longitudinal studies have been conducted on the prognosis of PPS, but speculations have been made by several physicians based on experience. Fatigue and mobility usually return to normal over a long period of time. The prognosis also differs depending upon different causes and factors affecting the individual. An overall mortality rate of 25% exists due to possible respiratory paralysis of persons with PPS; otherwise, it is usually not lethal.\\n\\nPrognosis can be abruptly changed for the worse by the use of anesthesia, such as during surgery.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nOld data show PPS occurs in roughly 25 to 50% of people who survive a polio infection. However newer data from countries that have contacted their polio survivors have shown 85% of their polio survivors to have symptoms of post polio syndrome. Typically, it occurs 30–35 years afterwards, but delays  between 8 and 71 years have been recorded. The disease occurs sooner in persons with more severe initial infections. Other factors that increase the risk of PPS include increasing length of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and being female.PPS is documented to occur in cases of nonparalytic polio (NPP). One review states late-onset weakness and fatigue occur in 14–42% of NPP patients.\\n\\nSee also\\n History of polio\\n List of polio survivors\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n \\n Maynard, F.M., & Headley, J.H.

       "       'Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition in which there is compression of the nerves, arteries, or veins in the passageway from the lower neck to the armpit. There are three main types: neurogenic, venous, and arterial. The neurogenic type is the most common and presents with pain, weakness, and occasionally loss of muscle at the base of the thumb. The venous type results in swelling, pain, and possibly a bluish coloration of the arm. The arterial type results in pain, coldness, and pallor of the arm.\\n\\nTOS may result from trauma, repetitive arm movements, tumors, pregnancy, or anatomical variations such as a cervical rib. The diagnosis may be supported by nerve conduction studies and medical imaging. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include rotator cuff tear, cervical disc disorders, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and complex regional pain syndrome.\\n\\nInitial treatment for the neurogenic type is with exercises to strengthen the chest muscles and improve posture. NSAIDs such as naproxen may be used for pain. Surgery is typically done for the arterial and venous types and for the neurogenic type if it does not improve with other treatments. Blood thinners may be used to treat or prevent blood clots. The condition affects about 1% of the population. It is more common in women than men and it occurs most commonly between 20 and 50 years of age. The condition was first described in 1818 and the current term \"thoracic outlet syndrome\" first used in 1956.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nTOS affects mainly the upper limbs, with signs and symptoms manifesting in the shoulders, neck, arms and hands. Pain can be present on an intermittent or permanent basis. It can be sharp/stabbing, burning, or aching. TOS can involve only part of the hand (as in the pinky and adjacent half of the ring finger), all of the hand, or the inner aspect of the forearm and upper arm. Pain can also be in the side of the neck, the pectoral area below the clavicle, the armpit/axillary area, and the upper back (i.e., the trapezius and rhomboid area). Discoloration of the hands, one hand colder than the other hand, weakness of the hand and arm muscles, and tingling are commonly present.\\n\\nOnly 1% of people with carpal tunnel syndrome have concomitant TOS.\\n\\nRepetitive motions can cause enlargement of muscles which causes compression of veins. Besides, overuse injury of the upper limbs causes swellings, small bleeding, and subsequent fibrosis which would cause the thrombosis of the subclavian vein, leading to Paget–Schroetter disease or effort-induced thrombosis.\\n\\nTOS can be related to cerebrovascular arterial insufficiency when affecting the subclavian artery. It also can affect the vertebral artery, in which case it could produce vision disturbances, including transient blindness, and embolic cerebral infarction.\\n\\nTOS can also lead to eye problems and vision loss as a circumstance of vertebral artery compression. Although very rare, if compression of the brain stem is also involved in an individual presentation of TOS, transient blindness may occur while the head is held in certain positions.\\nIf left untreated, TOS can lead to neurological deficits as a result of the hypoperfusion and hypometabolism of certain areas of the brain and cerebellum.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nTOS can be attributed to one or more of the following factors:\\n Congenital abnormalities are frequently found in persons with TOS. These include cervical rib, prolonged transverse process, and muscular abnormalities (e.g., in the scalenus anterior muscle, a sickle-shaped scalenus medius) or fibrous connective tissue anomalies.\\n Trauma (e.g., whiplash injuries) or repetitive strain is frequently implicated.\\n Rarer acquired causes include tumors (especially pancoast tumor), hyperostosis, and osteomyelitis\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nAdson\\'s sign and the costoclavicular maneuver lack specificity and sensitivity and should make up only a small part of the mandatory comprehensive history and physical examination undertaken with a patient suspected of having TOS. There is currently no single clinical sign that makes the diagnosis of TOS with any degree of certainty.\\n\\nAdditional maneuvers that may be abnormal in TOS include Wright\\'s Test, which involves hyperabducting the arms over the head with some extension and evaluating for loss of radial pulses or signs of blanching of the skin in the hands indicating a decrease in blood flow with the maneuver. The \"compression test\" is also used, exerting pressure between the clavicle and medial humeral head causes radiation of pain and/or numbness into the affected arm.\\n\\nDoppler arteriography, with probes at the fingertips and arms, tests the force and \"smoothness\" of the blood flow through the radial arteries, with and without having the patient perform various arm maneuvers (which causes compression of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet). The movements can elicit symptoms of pain and numbness and produce graphs with diminished arterial blood flow to the fingertips, providing strong evidence of impingement of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet. Doppler arteriography does not utilize probes at the fingertips and arms, and in this case is likely being confused with plethysmography, which is a different method that utilizes ultrasound without direct visualization of the affected vessels. Doppler ultrasound (not really \\'arteriography\\') would not be used at the radial artery in order to make the diagnosis of TOS. Finally, even if a Doppler study of the appropriate artery were to be positive, it would not diagnose neurogenic TOS, by far the most common subtype of TOS. There is plenty of evidence in the medical literature to show that arterial compression does not equate to brachial plexus compression, although they may occur together, in varying degrees. Additionally, arterial compression by itself does not make the diagnosis of arterial TOS (the rarest form of TOS). Lesser degrees of arterial compression have been shown in normal individuals in various arm positions and are thought to be of little significance without the other criteria for arterial TOS.\\n\\nMRI scan can show the anatomy of the thoracic outlet, the soft tissues causing compression, and can show directly the brachial plexus compression.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nBy structures affected and symptomatology\\nThere are three main types of TOS, named according to the cause of the symptoms; however, these three classifications have been coming into disfavor because TOS can involve all three types of compression to various degrees. The compression can occur in three anatomical structures (arteries, veins and nerves), it can be isolated, or, more commonly, two or three of the structures are compressed to greater or lesser degrees. In addition, the compressive forces can be of different magnitude in each affected structure.  Therefore, symptoms can be variable.\\n Neurogenic TOS includes disorders produced by compression of components of the brachial plexus nerves. The neurogenic form of TOS accounts for 95% of all cases of TOS.\\n Arterial TOS is due to compression of the subclavian artery. This is less than one percent of cases.\\n Venous TOS is due to compression of the subclavian vein. This makes up about 4% of cases.\\n\\nBy event\\nThere are many causes of TOS. The most frequent cause is trauma, either sudden (as in a clavicle fracture caused by a car accident), or repetitive (as in a legal secretary who works with his/her hands, wrists, and arms at a fast paced desk station with non-ergonomic posture for many years). TOS is also found in certain occupations involving much lifting of the arms and repetitive use of the wrists and arms .\\n\\nOne cause of arterial compression is trauma, and a recent case involving fracture of the clavicle has been reported.\\n\\nThe two groups of people most likely to develop TOS are those suffering from neck injuries due to traffic accidents and those who use computers in non-ergonomic postures for extended periods of time. TOS is frequently a repetitive stress injury (RSI) caused by certain types of work environments.\\n\\nBy structure causing constriction\\nIt is also possible to classify TOS by the location of the obstruction:\\n Anterior scalene syndrome (compression on brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery caused by muscle growth).\\n Cervical rib syndrome (compression on brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery caused by bone growth).\\n Costoclavicular syndrome (narrowing between the clavicle and the first rib) – diagnosed with the costoclavicular maneuver.\\n\\nSome people are born with an extra incomplete and very small rib above their first rib, which protrudes out into the superior thoracic outlet space. This rudimentary rib causes fibrous changes around the brachial plexus nerves, inducing compression and causing the symptoms and signs of TOS. This is called a \"cervical rib\" because of its attachment to C-7 (the seventh cervical vertebra), and its surgical removal is almost always recommended. The symptoms of TOS can first appear in the early teen years as a child is becoming more athletic.\\n\\nTreatment\\nEvidence for the treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome as of 2014 is poor.\\n\\nPhysical measures\\nStretching, occupational and physical therapy are common non-invasive approaches used in the treatment of TOS. The goal of stretching is to relieve compression in the thoracic cavity, reduce blood vessel and nerve impingement, and realign the bones, muscles, ligaments, or tendons that are causing the problem.\\n One commonly prescribed set of stretches includes moving the shoulders anteriorly (forward – called \"hunching\"), then back to a neutral position, then extending them posteriorly (backward, called \"arching\"), then back to neutral, followed by lifting the shoulders up as high as possible, and then back down to neutral, repeated in cycles as tolerated.\\n Another set of stretches involves tilting and extending the neck opposite to the side of the injury while keeping the injured arm down or wrapped around the back.\\n Occupational or Physical therapy can include passive or active range of motion exercises, working up to weighted or restricted sets (as tolerated).\\n\\nTOS is rapidly aggravated by poor posture. Active breathing exercises and ergonomic desk setup and motion practices can help maintain active posture. Often the muscles in the back become weak due to prolonged (years of) \"hunching\" and other poor postures.\\n\\nIce can be used to decrease inflammation of sore or injured muscles. Heat can also aid in relieving sore muscles by improving blood circulation to them. While the whole arm generally feels painful in TOS, some relief can be seen when ice or heat is intermittently applied to the thoracic region (collar bone, armpit, or shoulder blades).\\n\\nMedications\\nIn a review, botox was compared to a placebo injected into the scalene muscles. No effect in terms of pain relief or improved movement was noted. However in a six-months follow-up, paresthesia (abnormal sensations such as in pins and needles) was seen to be significantly improved.\\n\\nSurgery\\nSurgical approaches have also been used successfully in TOS. Microsurgery can be used approaching the area from above the collar bone (supraclavicular) followed by neurolysis of the brachial plexus, removal of the scalene muscle (scalenectomy), and the release of the underlying (subclavicular) blood vessels. This approach avoids the use of resection, and has been found to be an effective treatment. In cases where the first rib (or a fibrous band extending from the first rib) is compressing a vein, artery, or the nerve bundle, part of the first rib and any compressive fibrous tissue, can be removed in a first rib resection and thoracic outlet decompression surgical procedure; scalene muscles may also need to be removed (scalenectomy). This allows increased blood flow and the reduction of nerve compression. In some cases there may be a rudimentary rib or a cervical rib that can be causing the compression, which can be removed using the same technique.\\n\\nPhysical therapy is often used before and after the operation to improve recovery time and outcomes. Potential complications include pneumothorax, infection, loss of sensation, motor problems, subclavian vessel damage, and, as in all surgeries, a very small risk of permanent serious injury or death.\\n\\nNotable cases\\nSports\\nSeveral Major League Baseball players, especially pitchers, have been diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, including Chris Archer, Matt Harvey, Chris Carpenter, Jaime Garcia, Shaun Marcum, Matt Harrison, Clayton Richard, Nate Karns, and Noah Lowry. Starting pitcher Chris Young, who previously struggled with shoulder problems, underwent surgery for TOS in 2013 and felt \"completely different\" post-recovery. Young exceeded expectations on his return to the major leagues at age 35, becoming a valuable member of the 2014 Seattle Mariners\\' starting rotation. In July 1980, Houston Astros starting pitcher J.R. Richard collapsed while playing a game of catch, and was found to have experienced a stroke due to severe blockage of his right carotid artery. Given the fact that shortly beforehand, he had been found to have near-total obstruction of the arteries supplying his right arm, he was eventually diagnosed with extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. Although he attempted a comeback, his professional baseball career was effectively ended.\\n\\nNHL defenseman Adam McQuaid was diagnosed with TOS in September 2012, and as a result was nominated for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Forward Chris Kreider was diagnosed with a malformed rib in 2017. Kreider dealt with multiple symptoms prior to the diagnosis, such as shortness of breath on the ice, swelling/numbness in his right arm, coughing up blood and a blood clot in his right arm. Kreider underwent successful surgery to resect a rib in January 2018 (the same surgery as TOS) and has performed well since returning to the Rangers.\\n\\nNBA guard Markelle Fultz was diagnosed with TOS in December 2018.\\n\\nUFC fighter Matt Serra had a rib removed to alleviate TOS.\\n\\nMusic\\nMusician Isaac Hanson had a pulmonary embolism as a consequence of thoracic outlet syndrome.\\n\\nThe Japanese band Maria disbanded in 2010 due to drummer Tattsu\\'s TOS which made it impossible for her to continue playing.\\n\\nIn 2015, singer Tamar Braxton had to leave Dancing With The Stars due to TOS.\\n\\nSee also \\n May–Thurner syndrome – a similar compressive pathology involving the left common iliac vein\\n Backpack palsy – a similar compressive pathology involving the long thoracic nerve, or adjacent brachial plexis nerves\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n \\n\\nPeripheral nervous system disorders\\nSyndromes\\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate'],\n",

       "       'Barnard\\'s Star  is a red dwarf about six light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It is the fourth-nearest-known individual star to the Sun after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system, and the closest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. Its stellar mass is about 14% of the Sun\\'s. Despite its proximity, the star has a dim apparent magnitude of +9.5 and is invisible to the unaided eye; it is much brighter in the infrared than in visible light.\\n\\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E. E. Barnard, who in 1916 measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year relative to the Sun, the highest known for any star. The star had previously appeared on Harvard University photographic plates in 1888 and 1890.\\n\\nBarnard\\'s Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. Historically, research on Barnard\\'s Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. Although Barnard\\'s Star is ancient, it still experiences star flare events, one being observed in 1998.\\n\\nFrom the early 1960s to the early 1970s, Peter van de Kamp argued that planets orbited Barnard\\'s star. His specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s after much debate.\\n\\nIn November 2018, a candidate super-Earth planetary companion known as Barnard\\'s Star b was reported to orbit Barnard\\'s Star. It was believed to have a minimum of  (Earth masses) and orbit at .  However, work presented in July 2021 cast doubts upon the existence of this planet.\\n\\nNaming \\nIn 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Barnard\\'s Star for this star on 1 February 2017 and it is now included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\\n\\nDescription \\n\\nBarnard\\'s Star is a red dwarf of the dim spectral type M4, and it is too faint to see without a telescope. Its apparent magnitude is 9.5.\\n\\nAt 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard\\'s Star is considerably older than the Sun, which is 4.5 billion years old, and it might be among the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Barnard\\'s Star has lost a great deal of rotational energy, and the periodic slight changes in its brightness indicate that it rotates once in 130 days (the Sun rotates in 25). Given its age, Barnard\\'s Star was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. In 1998, astronomers observed an intense stellar flare, showing that Barnard\\'s Star is a flare star. Barnard\\'s Star has the variable star designation V2500 Ophiuchi. In 2003, Barnard\\'s Star presented the first detectable change in the radial velocity of a star caused by its motion. Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard\\'s Star was attributed to its stellar activity.\\n\\nThe proper motion of Barnard\\'s Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90km/s. The 10.3 arcseconds it travels in a year amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.\\n\\nThe radial velocity of Barnard\\'s Star towards the Sun is measured from its blueshift to be −110km/s. Combined with its proper motion, this gives a space velocity (actual velocity relative to the Sun) of −142.6 ± 0.2km/s. Barnard\\'s Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around 11,800 CE, when it will approach to within about 3.75 light-years.\\n\\nProxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a position currently 4.24 light-years distant from it. However, despite Barnard\\'s Star\\'s even closer pass to the Sun in 11,800 CE, it will still not then be the nearest star, since by that time Proxima Centauri will have moved to a yet-nearer proximity to the Sun. At the time of the star\\'s closest pass by the Sun, Barnard\\'s Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye, since its apparent magnitude will only have increased by one magnitude to about 8.5 by then, still being 2.5 magnitudes short of visibility to the naked eye.\\n\\nBarnard\\'s Star has a mass of about 0.14 solar masses (), and a radius 0.2 times that of the Sun. Thus, although Barnard\\'s Star has roughly 150 times the mass of Jupiter (), its radius is only roughly 2 times larger, due to its much higher density. Its effective temperature is 3,100 kelvin, and it has a visual luminosity of 0.0004 solar luminosities. Barnard\\'s Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is, it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon, comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 astronomical units.\\n\\nBarnard\\'s Star has 10–32% of the solar metallicity. Metallicity is the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than helium and helps classify stars relative to the galactic population. Barnard\\'s Star seems to be typical of the old, red dwarf population II stars, yet these are also generally metal-poor halo stars. While sub-solar, Barnard\\'s Star\\'s metallicity is higher than that of a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal-rich disk star range; this, plus its high space motion, have led to the designation \"intermediate population II star\", between a halo and disk star. Although some recently published scientific papers have given much higher estimates for the metallicity of the star, very close to the Sun\\'s level, between 75 and 125% of the solar metallicity.\\n\\nPlanetary system\\n\\nIn November 2018 an international team of astronomers announced the detection of a candidate super-Earth orbiting in relatively close proximity to Barnard\\'s Star. Led by Ignasi Ribas of Spain their work, conducted over two decades of observation, provided strong evidence of the planet\\'s existence. However, the existence of the planet was questioned in 2021, because the radial velocity signal with the planetary orbital period apparently vanished in newer data.\\n\\nDubbed Barnard\\'s Star b, the planet was found near the stellar system\\'s snow line, which is an ideal spot for the icy accretion of proto-planetary material. It orbits at 0.4AU every 233 days and has a proposed mass of . The planet is most likely frigid, with an estimated surface temperature of about , and lies outside Barnard Star\\'s presumed habitable zone. However, more work is needed on the planet\\'s atmospherics to better understand surface conditions. Direct imaging of the planet and its tell-tale light signature are possible in the decade after its discovery. Further faint and unaccounted-for perturbations in the system suggest there may be a second planetary companion even farther out.\\n\\nPrevious planetary claims \\n\\nFor a decade from 1963 to about 1973, a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by Peter van de Kamp that he had detected, by using astrometry, a perturbation in the proper motion of Barnard\\'s Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with Jupiter. Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938, attempting, with colleagues at the Sproul Observatory at Swarthmore College, to find minuscule variations of one micrometre in its position on photographic plates consistent with orbital perturbations that would indicate a planetary companion; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates, to avoid systemic individual errors. Van de Kamp\\'s initial suggestion was a planet having about  at a distance of 4.4AU in a slightly eccentric orbit, and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper. Later that year, Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1.1 and .\\n\\nOther astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp\\'s measurements, and two papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets. George Gatewood and Heinrich Eichhorn, at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques, failed to verify the planetary companion. Another paper published by John L. Hershey four months earlier, also using the Swarthmore observatory, found that changes in the astrometric field of various stars correlated to the timing of adjustments and modifications that had been carried out on the refractor telescope\\'s objective lens; the claimed planet was attributed to an artifact of maintenance and upgrade work. The affair has been discussed as part of a broader scientific review.\\n\\nVan de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further claim of two planets\\' existence as late as 1982; he died in 1995. Wulff Heintz, Van de Kamp\\'s successor at Swarthmore and an expert on double stars, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards. The two men were reported to have become estranged because of this.\\n\\nRefining planetary boundaries \\n\\nFor the more than four decades between van de Kamp\\'s rejected claim and the eventual announcement of a planet candidate, Barnard\\'s Star was carefully studied and the mass and orbital boundaries for possible planets were slowly tightened. M dwarfs such as Barnard\\'s Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious.\\n\\nNull results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including interferometric work with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999. Gatewood was able to show in 1995 that planets with  were impossible around Barnard\\'s Star, in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general. In 1999, the Hubble work further excluded planetary companions of  with an orbital period of less than 1,000 days (Jupiter\\'s orbital period is 4,332 days), while Kuerster determined in 2003 that within the habitable zone around Barnard\\'s Star, planets are not possible with an \"M sin i\" value greater than 7.5 times the mass of the Earth (), or with a mass greater than 3.1 times the mass of Neptune (much lower than van de Kamp\\'s smallest suggested value).\\n\\nIn 2013, a research paper was published that further refined planet mass boundaries for the star. Using radial velocity measurements, taken over a period of 25 years, from the Lick and Keck Observatories and applying Monte Carlo analysis for both circular and eccentric orbits, upper masses for planets out to 1,000-day orbits were determined. Planets above two Earth masses in orbits of less than 10 days were excluded, and planets of more than ten Earth masses out to a two-year orbit were also confidently ruled out. It was also discovered that the habitable zone of the star seemed to be devoid of roughly Earth-mass planets or larger, save for face-on orbits.\\n\\nEven though this research greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard\\'s Star, it did not rule them out completely as terrestrial planets were always going to be difficult to detect. NASA\\'s Space Interferometry Mission, which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard\\'s Star as an early search target, however the mission was shut down in 2010. ESA\\'s similar Darwin interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007.\\n\\nThe analysis of radial velocities that eventually led to discovery of the candidate super-Earth orbiting Barnard\\'s Star was also used to set more precise upper mass limits for possible planets, up to and within the habitable zone: a maximum of  up to the inner edge and  on the outer edge of the optimistic habitable zone, corresponding to orbital periods of up to 10 and 40 days respectively. Therefore, it appears that Barnard\\'s Star indeed does not host Earth-mass planets, or larger, in hot and temperate orbits, unlike other M-dwarf stars that commonly have these type of planets in close-in orbits.\\n\\nProposed exploration\\n\\nProject Daedalus \\n\\nBarnard\\'s Star was studied as part of Project Daedalus. Undertaken between 1973 and 1978, the study suggested that rapid, unmanned travel to another star system was possible with existing or near-future technology. Barnard\\'s Star was chosen as a target partly because it was believed to have planets.\\n\\nThe theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing nuclear fusion (specifically, electron bombardment of deuterium and helium-3) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12% of the speed of light. The star could then be reached in 50 years, within a human lifetime. Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions, the interstellar medium would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed.\\n\\nThe initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research. In 1980, Robert Freitas suggested a more ambitious plan: a self-replicating spacecraft intended to search for and make contact with extraterrestrial life. Built and launched in Jupiter\\'s orbit, it would reach Barnard\\'s Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus. Once at the star, it would begin automated self-replication, constructing a factory, initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1,000 years.\\n\\n1998 flare \\nIn 1998 a stellar flare on Barnard\\'s Star was detected based on changes in the spectral emissions on 17 July during an unrelated search for variations in the proper motion. Four years passed before the flare was fully analyzed, at which point it was suggested that the flare\\'s temperature was 8,000K, more than twice the normal temperature of the star. Given the essentially random nature of flares, Diane Paulson, one of the authors of that study, noted that \"the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe\".\\n\\nThe flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected in stars of such age. Flares are not completely understood, but are believed to be caused by strong magnetic fields, which suppress plasma convection and lead to sudden outbursts: strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars, while old stars tend to rotate slowly. For Barnard\\'s Star to undergo an event of such magnitude is thus presumed to be a rarity. Research on the star\\'s periodicity, or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale, also suggest it ought to be quiescent; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in the star\\'s brightness, noting only one possible starspot over 130 days.\\n\\nStellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard\\'s Star as a proxy to understand similar stars. It is hoped that photometric studies of its X-ray and UV emissions will shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy. Such research has astrobiological implications: given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star, any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares, winds, and plasma ejection events.\\n\\n2019 flares\\nIn 2019, two additional ultraviolet stellar flares were detected, each with far-ultraviolet energy of 3×1022 joules, together with one X-ray stellar flare with energy 1.6×1022 joules. The flare rate observed to date is enough to cause loss of 87 Earth atmospheres per billion years through thermal processes and ≈3 Earth atmospheres per billion years through ion loss processes on Barnard\\'s Star b.\\n\\nEnvironment \\nBarnard\\'s Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun. The neighbors of Barnard\\'s Star are generally of red dwarf size, the smallest and most common star type. Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf Ross 154, at a distance of 1.66 parsecs (5.41 light-years). The Sun and Alpha Centauri are, respectively, the next closest systems. From Barnard\\'s Star, the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA=, Dec=, in the westernmost part of the constellation Monoceros. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83, and at a distance of 1.834 parsecs, it would be a first-magnitude star, as Pollux is from the Earth.\\n\\nSee also \\n Kepler-42 – Nearly identical to Barnard\\'s star, and hosts three sub-Earth sized planets.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n \\n \\n  Amateur work showing Barnard\\'s Star movement over time.\\n  Animated image with frames approx. one year apart, beginning in 2007, showing the movement of Barnard\\'s Star.\\n \\n\\nDiscoveries by Edward Emerson Barnard\\nHigh-proper-motion stars\\nM-type main-sequence stars\\nOphiuchus (constellation)\\nBY Draconis variables\\nStars with proper names\\nOphiuchi, V2500\\n0699\\nBD+04 3561A\\n087937\\n?\\nLocal Interstellar Cloud\\nPlanetary systems with one confirmed planet\\nJ17574849+0441405',\n",

       "       'Gliese 581 () is a red dwarf star of spectral type M3V at the center of the Gliese 581 planetary system, about 20 light years away from Earth in the Libra constellation. Its estimated mass is about a third of that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star to the Sun. Gliese 581 is one of the oldest, least active M dwarfs known. Its low stellar activity improves the likelihood of its planets retaining significant atmospheres, and lessens the sterilizing impact of stellar flares.\\n\\nHistory of observations\\nGliese 581 is known at least from 1886, when it was included in Eduard Schönfeld\\'s Southern  (SD)—the fourth part of the . The corresponding designation is BD -7 4003.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nThe name Gliese 581 refers to the catalog number from the 1957 survey Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of the Earth. Other names of this star include BD-07° 4003 (BD catalogue, first known publication) and HO Librae (variable star designation). It does not have an individual name such as Sirius or Procyon. The star is a red dwarf with spectral type M3V, located 20.4 light-years away from Earth. It is located about two degrees north of Beta Librae, the brightest star in the Libra constellation. Its mass is estimated to be approximately a third that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star system to the Sun.\\n\\nAn M-class dwarf star such as Gliese 581 has a much lower mass than the Sun, causing the core region of the star to fuse hydrogen at a significantly lower rate. From the apparent magnitude and distance, astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0.2% of that of the Sun. However, a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared, with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm (estimated using Wien\\'s displacement law, which assumes the star radiates as a black body), so such an estimate will underestimate the star\\'s total luminosity. (For comparison, the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530\\xa0nm, in the middle of the visible part of the spectrum.) When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account (not just the part that humans are able to see), something known as the bolometric correction, this star has a bolometric luminosity 1.3% of the Sun\\'s total luminosity. A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth. The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the \"Goldilocks Zone\", or, more prosaically, the habitable zone. The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system. Gliese 581 is a very old star. Its slow rotation makes it very inactive, making it better suited than most red dwarfs for having habitable planets.\\n\\nGliese 581 is classified as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability because of the presence of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%.

The system is known to consist of at least three planets discovered using the radial velocity method, along with a debris disk. The system\\'s notability is due primarily to early exoplanetology discoveries, between 2008 and 2010, of possible terrestrial planets orbiting within its habitable zone and the system\\'s relatively close proximity to the Solar System at 20 light years away. However, its observation history is controversial due to false detections and conjecture and with the radial velocity method yielding little information about the planets themselves beyond their mass.\\n\\nThe confirmed planets are believed to be located close to the star with near-circular orbits. In order of distance from the star, these are Gliese 581e, Gliese 581b, and Gliese 581c. The letters represent the discovery order, with b being the first planet to be discovered around the star.\\n\\nObservation history \\nThe first announcement of a planet around the star was Gliese 581b discovered by astronomers at the Observatory of Geneva in Switzerland and Grenoble University in France. Detected in August 2005 and using extensive data from the ESO/HARPS spectrometer it was the fifth planet to be discovered around a red dwarf. Further observations by the same group resulted in the detection of two more planets, Gliese 581c and Gliese 581d. The orbital period of Gliese 581d was originally thought to be 83 days but was later revised to a lower value of 67 days. The revised orbital distance would place it at the outer limits of the habitable zone, the distance at which it is believed possible for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planetary body, given favourable atmospheric conditions. Gliese 581d was estimated to receive about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth, though if high levels of carbon dioxide are present in the planetary atmosphere, the greenhouse effect could keep temperatures above freezing.\\n\\nThe next discovery was the inner planet Gliese 581e, also by the Observatory of Geneva and using data from the HARPS instrument, was announced on 21 April 2009. This planet, at a minimum mass of 1.9 Earths, was at the time the least massive confirmed exoplanet identified around a main-sequence star.\\n\\nOn 29 September 2010, astronomers using the Keck Observatory proposed two additional planets, Gliese 581f and Gliese 581g, both in nearly circular orbits based on analysis of a combination of data sets from the HARPS and HIRES instruments. The proposed planet Gliese 581f was thought to be a 7 Earth-mass planet in a 433-day orbit and too cold to support liquid water. The candidate planet Gliese 581g attracted more attention: nicknamed Zarmina\\'s World by one of its discoverers, the predicted mass of Gliese 581g was between 3 and 4 Earth-masses, with an orbital period of 37 days. The orbital distance was calculated to be well within the star\\'s habitable zone, though the planet was expected to be tidally locked with one side of the planet always facing the star. In an interview with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked what he thought about the chances of life existing on Gliese 581g. Vogt was optimistic: \"I\\'m not a biologist, nor do I want to play one on TV. Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that ... the chances of life on this planet are 100%. I have almost no doubt about it.\"\\n\\nTwo weeks after the announcement of the discovery of  and , astronomer Francesco Pepe of the Geneva Observatory reported that in a new analysis of 179 measurements taken by the HARPS spectrograph over 6.5 years, neither planet g nor planet f was detectable, and the relevant measurements were included in a paper uploaded to the arXiv preprint server, though still unpublished in a refereed journal. The non-existence of Gliese 581f was accepted relatively quickly: it was shown that the radial velocity variations that led to the claimed discovery of Gliese 581f were instead associated with the stellar activity cycle rather than an orbiting planet. Nevertheless, the existence of planet g remained controversial: Vogt responded in the media that he stood by the discovery and questions arose as to whether the effect was due to the assumption of circular rather than eccentric orbits or the statistical methods used.\\n\\nBayesian analysis found no clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the combined HIRES/HARPS data set, though other studies led to the conclusion that the data did support the existence of planet g, albeit with strong degeneracies in the parameters as a result of the first eccentric harmonic with the outer planet Gliese 581d.\\n\\nUsing the assumption that the noise present in the data was correlated (red noise rather than white noise), Roman Baluev called into question not only the existence of planet g, but Gliese 581d as well, suggesting there were only three planets (Gliese 581b, c, and e) present.\\n\\nOn 27 November 2012, the European Space Agency announced that the Herschel space observatory had discovered a comet belt \"at 25 ± 12 AU to more than 60 AU\". It must have \"at least 10 times\" as many comets as does the Solar system. This likely rules out Saturn-mass planets beyond 0.75 AU. However another (undiscovered) planet further out, say a Neptune-mass planet at 5 AU, might be required to keep the comet belt replenished.\\n\\nA different objection against the existence of Gliese 581d was offered in a 2014 study whose authors argued that Gliese 581d is \"an artifact of stellar activity which, when incompletely corrected, causes the false detection of the planet g.\" This remains controversial, with one 2015 paper agreeing with the 2014 analysis and another disagreeing with it.\\n\\nPlanets \\n\\nOngoing analysis of the system has produced several models for the orbital arrangement of the system. There is no current consensus and 3-planet, 4-planet, 5-planet and 6-planet models have been proposed to address the available radial velocity data. Most of these models predict, however, that the inner planets are close in with circular orbits, while outer planets, particularly Gliese 581d, should it exist, are on more elliptical orbits.\\n\\nModels of the habitable zone of Gliese 581 show that it extends from about 0.1 to 0.5 AU taking in part of the orbit of Gliese 581d. The first three planets orbit closer to the star than the inner edge of the habitable zone, with planets d and g orbiting within it.\\n\\nConfirmed planets\\n\\nGliese 581e \\n\\nGliese 581e is the innermost planet and, with a minimum mass of 1.7 Earth masses, is the least massive of the three. Discovered in 2009, it is also the most recent confirmed planet to have been discovered in this system. It takes 3.15 days to complete an orbit. Initial analyses suggested that the planet\\'s orbit is quite elliptical but after correcting the radial velocity measurements for stellar activity, the data now indicate a circular orbit.\\n\\nGliese 581b \\n\\nGliese 581b is the most massive planet known to be orbiting Gliese 581 and was the first to be discovered.\\n\\nGliese 581c \\n\\nGliese 581c is the third planet orbiting Gliese 581. It was discovered in April 2007. In their 2007 paper, Udry et al. asserted that if Gliese 581c has an Earth-type composition, it would have a radius of 1.5R🜨, which would have made it at the time \"the most Earth-like of all known exoplanets\". A direct measurement of the radius cannot be taken because, viewed from Earth, the planet does not transit its star. The minimum mass of the planet is 5.5 times that of Earth. The planet initially attracted attention as being potentially habitable, though this has since been discounted. The mean blackbody surface temperature has been estimated to lie between −3\\xa0°C (for a Venus-like albedo) and 40\\xa0°C (for an Earth-like albedo), however, the temperatures could be much higher (about 500 degrees Celsius) due to a runaway greenhouse effect akin to that of Venus. Some astronomers believe the system may have undergone planetary migration and Gliese 581c may have formed beyond the frost line, with a composition similar to icy bodies like Ganymede. Gliese 581c completes a full orbit in just under 13 days.\\n\\nUnconfirmed planets\\n\\nGliese 581g \\n\\nGliese 581g, unofficially known as Zarmina\\'s World, is an unconfirmed (and disputed) exoplanet claimed to orbit within the Gliese 581 planetary system, twenty light-years from Earth. It was discovered by the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, and is the sixth planet found orbiting the star (Gliese 581 f was found to be an artifact); however, its existence could not be confirmed by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) / High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) survey team, and its existence remains controversial. It is thought to be near the middle of the habitable zone of its star. That means it could sustain liquid water—a necessity for all known life—on its surface, if there are favorable atmospheric conditions on the planet.\\n\\nGliese 581g was claimed to be detected by astronomers of the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey. The authors stated that data sets from both High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and HARPS were needed to sense the planet; however, the ESO/HARPS survey team could not confirm its existence. The planet remained unconfirmed as consensus for its existence could not be reached. Additional reanalysis only found evidence for four planets, but the discoverer, Steven S. Vogt, did not agree with those conclusions; another study by Guillem Anglada-Escudé later supported the planet\\'s existence. In 2012, a reanalysis by Vogt supported its existence. A new study in 2014 concluded that it was a false positive; however, in 2015, a reanalysis of the data suggested that it could still exist. The planet is thought to be tidally locked to its star. If the planet has a dense atmosphere, it may be able to circulate heat. The actual habitability of the planet depends on the composition of its surface and the atmosphere. It is thought to have temperatures around −37 to −11\\xa0°C (−35 to 10\\xa0°F). By comparison, Earth has an average surface temperature of 15\\xa0°C (59\\xa0°F)—while Mars has an average surface temperatures of about −63\\xa0°C (−81\\xa0°F). The planet has, according to Vogt, a \"100%\" chance of supporting life, but this is disputed.\\n\\nGliese 581d \\n\\nGliese 581d is an exoplanet that is currently disputed due to inaccurate analysis caused by noise and stellar activity, and is considered disproven by the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This remains controversial, with one 2015 paper agreeing with the 2014 analysis and another disagreeing with it. A 2019 paper on planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs lists GJ 581 d (although they designate it GJ 581 e). The planet\\'s mass is thought to be 6.98 Earths and its radius, assuming an Earth-like composition, is thought to be 2.2R🜨, making it a super-Earth. Its orbital period is thought to be 66.87 days long, with a semi-major axis of 0.21847 AU, with an unconstrained eccentricity. Analysis suggests that it orbits within the star\\'s habitable zone, where the temperatures are just right to support life.\\n\\nSETI \\nThe Gliese 581 system has been the target of both SETI and Active SETI searches for extraterrestrial life.\\nA Message from Earth (AMFE) is a high-powered digital radio signal that was sent on 9 October 2008, toward Gliese 581c. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope radar telescope of the National Space Agency of Ukraine. The signal will reach Gliese 581 in early 2029.\\n\\nUsing optical SETI, Ragbir Bhathal claimed to have detected an unexplained pulse of light from the direction of the Gliese 581 system in 2008.\\n\\nIn 2012, the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research at Curtin University in Perth, Gliese 581 was precisely targeted by Australian Long Baseline Array using three radio telescope facilities across Australia and the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique, however no candidate signals were found.\\n\\nDebris disk \\nAt the outer edge of the system is a massive debris disk containing more comets than the Solar System. The debris disc has an inclination between 30° and 70°. If the planetary orbits lie in the same plane, their masses would be between 1.1 and 2 times the minimum mass values.\\n\\nSee also\\n Habitability of red dwarf systems\\n Lists of exoplanets\\n Gliese 876\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life Space.com\\n Gliese 581 / HO Librae Solstation.com\\n Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia: Gl 581\\n AstronomyCast: Gliese 581\\n SETI Range Calculator\\n All Wet?

The RECONS accurately determined its distance in 1997. At that time, it was the 20th-nearest star system to the Sun. The discovery team noted that many more stars like this are likely to be discovered nearby.\\n\\nThis star is a tiny, dim, red dwarf, close to the lower mass limit.

The planet Gliese 1061 d orbits in the conservative circumstellar habitable zone of its star and the planet Gliese 1061 c orbits in the inner edge of the habitable zone. Gliese 1061 is a non-variable star that does not suffer flares, so there is a greater probability that the exoplanets still conserve their atmosphere if they had one.\\n\\nGliese 1061 c\\n\\nGliese 1061 c (also known as GJ 1061 c) is a potentially habitable exoplanet orbiting within the limits of the optimistic defined habitable zone of its red dwarf parent star.\\n\\nGliese 1061 c is 75% more massive than the Earth.\\n\\nThe planet receives 35% more stellar flux than Earth and has an equilibrium temperature of . The average temperature on the surface would be warmer, , provided the atmosphere is of similar composition to the Earth's.\\n\\nGliese 1061 c orbits its parent star very closely, every 6.7 days at a distance of just 0.035 au, so it is probably gravitationally locked and in synchronous rotation with its star.\\n\\nGliese 1061 d\\n\\n\\nGliese 1061 d (also known as GJ 1061 d) is a potentially habitable exoplanet largely orbiting within the limits of the conservative defined habitable zone of its parent red dwarf star.\\n\\nThe exoplanet is 68% more massive than the Earth.\\n\\nThe planet receives about 40% less stellar flux than Earth and has an estimated equilibrium temperature of . The average temperature on the surface would be colder than Earth's and at around , provided the atmosphere is similar to that of Earth.\\n\\nGliese 1061 d orbits its star every 13 days, and due to its close-in semi-major axis, it is likely that the exoplanet is tidally locked. However, if the planet's orbit is confirmed to be highly eccentric then this eccentricity could be desynchronising it, enabling the existence of non-synchronised states of equilibrium in its rotation, relative to which side of the planet is facing the star, and thereby it will experience a day/night cycle.\\n\\nSee also\\n List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs\\n Research Consortium On Nearby Stars\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n SolStation.com: GJ 1061\\n\\n1061\\nHorologium (constellation)\\nLocal Bubble\\nM-type main-sequence stars\\nPlanetary systems with three confirmed planets\\nTIC objects\",\n",

Astrometric measurements on Gliese 317 provided a significant update to the distance, putting the star at 15.3 pc, which is 65% further out than previously assumed. Using mass-luminosity calibrations, the new distance implies the star is significantly more massive and so are the planet candidates. The same astrometric measurements allowed to constrain the orbital inclination and put an upper limit to the mass of Gliese 317 b (98% confidence level) of 2.5 .\\n\\nThe second planet in the system was also confirmed with the additional new RV measurements, but the period and orbital parameters of Gliese 317 c were very uncertain (P>2000 days).

It is projected to pass near the Sun in about 1.29 million years at a predicted minimum distance of 0.051 parsecs— (about 160 billion km) -- about 1/25th of the current distance to Proxima Centauri. Such a distance would make for a similar brightness to the brightest planets, optimally reaching an apparent visual magnitude of about −2.7 (brighter than Mars at opposition). The star\\'s proper motion will peak around one arcminute per year, a rate of apparent motion that would be noticeable over a human lifespan. This is a timeframe, based on data from Gaia DR3,  well within the parameters of current models which cover the next 15 million years.\\n\\nDescription\\nGliese 710 currently is  from Earth in the constellation Serpens and has a below naked-eye visual magnitude of 9.69. A stellar classification of K7\\xa0Vk means it is a small main-sequence star mostly generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. (The suffix \\'k\\' indicates that the spectrum shows absorption lines from interstellar matter.) Stellar mass is about 60% of the Sun\\'s mass with an estimated 67% of the Sun\\'s radius. It is suspected to be a variable star that may vary in magnitude from 9.65 to 9.69. As of 2020, no planets have been detected orbiting it.\\n\\nComputing and details of the closest approach \\n\\nGliese\\xa0710 has the potential to perturb the Oort cloud in the outer Solar System, exerting enough force to send showers of comets into the inner Solar System for millions of years, triggering visibility of about ten naked-eye comets per year, and possibly causing an impact event. According to Filip Berski and Piotr Dybczyński, this event will be \"the strongest disrupting encounter in the future and history of the Solar System\". Earlier dynamic models indicated that the net increase in cratering rate due to the passage of Gliese\\xa0710 would be no more than\\xa05%. They had originally estimated that the closest approach would happen in 1,360,000\\xa0years when the star will approach within 0.337\\xa0±\\xa00.177\\xa0parsecs (1.100\\xa0± 0.577 light-years) of the Sun. Gaia DR2 now finds the minimum perihelion distance is 0.0676 ± 0.0157 parsecs or 13,900 ± 3,200 AU about 1.281 million years from now.\\n\\nBobylev in 2010 further suggested Gliese\\xa0710 has an 86% chance of passing through the Oort cloud, assuming the Oort cloud to be a spheroid around the Sun with semiminor and semimajor axes of 80,000 and 100,000\\xa0AU respectively. The distance of closest approach of Gliese\\xa0710 is difficult to compute precisely as it depends sensitively on its current position and velocity; Bobylev estimated that it would pass within 0.311\\xa0± 0.167 parsecs (1.014\\xa0± 0.545 light-years) of the Sun. At the time, there was even a 1 in 10,000 chance of the star penetrating into the region (d\\xa0<\\xa01,000\\xa0AU) where the influence of the passing star on Kuiper belt objects would be significant.\\n\\nResults from new calculations that include input data from Gaia EDR3 indicate that the flyby of Gliese 710 to the Solar System will on average be slightly closer at 0.051\\u2009±\\u20090.003\\u2009pc in 1.29\\u2009±\\u20090.04\\u2009Myr time, but with considerably less uncertainty. The effects of such an encounter on the orbit of the Pluto–Charon system (and therefore, on the classical trans-Neptunian belt) are negligible, but Gliese 710 will traverse the outer Oort cloud (inside 100,000\\u2009AU or 0.48\\u2009pc) and reach the outskirts of the inner Oort cloud (inward of 20,000\\u2009AU).\\n\\nTable of parameters of predictions of Gliese 710 encounter with Sun\\n\\nSee also \\n List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs\\n Impact event\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n SolStation.com\\n VizieR variable star database\\n Wikisky image of HD 168442 (Gliese 710)\\n \\n\\nBD-01 3474\\n168442\\n089825\\n0710\\nK-type main-sequence stars\\nSerpens (constellation)\\nTIC objects',\n",

The pair A-C have an estimated orbital period of about 70 years. While detected directly, Gliese 105 C has also been observed to perturb Gliese 105 A from its usual position; from that, its orbit is estimated to have a high eccentricity of around 0.64 and a semimajor axis of 17 au. Gliese 105 C is an extremely faint red dwarf. It is roughly 8 to 9 percent the mass of the Sun, and it is about 20,000 times fainter than its parent star in visible light—at a distance of 1 au (the distance from the Earth to the Sun) it would only be four times brighter than the full moon.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Gliese 105 / HR 753 ABC SolStation entry.\\n  Gliese 105\\n\\nCetus (constellation)\\nK-type main-sequence stars\\nM-type main-sequence stars\\nHR, 0753\\n016160\\n012114\\n0753\\nCeti, BX\\n0105\\nCeti, 268\\nTriple star systems\\nBD+06 398\\nTIC objects',\n",
       "       \"Gliese 876 d is an exoplanet approximately 15 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. It was the lowest-mass extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12 at the time of its discovery. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\n\\nMass, radius, and temperature\\nThe mass of Gliese 876 d from radial velocity has one problem, it is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° with respect to the plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.\\n\\nThe low mass of the planet has led to suggestions that it may be a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.\\n\\nAlternatively the planet could have formed further from Gliese 876, as a gas giant, and migrated inwards with the other gas giants. This would result in a composition richer in volatile substances, such as water. As it arrived in range, the star would have blown off the planet's hydrogen layer via coronal mass ejection. In this model, the planet would have a pressurised ocean of  water (in the form of a supercritical fluid) separated from the silicate core by a layer of ice kept frozen by the high pressures in the planetary interior. Such a planet would have an atmosphere containing water vapor and free oxygen produced by the breakdown of water by ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nDistinguishing between these two models would require more information about the planet's radius or composition. The planet does not transit its star, which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities.\\n\\nBased on models, the radius of the exoplanet, based on the mass, can probably be estimated around 1.65 .\\n\\nThe equilibrium temperature of Gliese 876 d, is estimated to be around .\\n\\nHost star\\nThe planet orbits a (M-type) star named Gliese 876. The star has a mass of 0.33  and a radius of around 0.36 . It has a surface temperature of 3350 K and is 2.55 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K.\\n\\nOrbit\\nGliese 876 d is located in an orbit with a semimajor axis of only 0.0208 AU (3.11 million km). At this distance from the star, tidal interactions should in theory circularize the orbit; however, measurements reveal that it has a high eccentricity of 0.207, comparable to that of Mercury in the Solar System.\\n\\nModels predict that, if its non-Keplerian orbit could be averaged to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0.28, then tidal heating would play a significant role in the planet's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten. Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it receives from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.\\n\\nDiscovery\\nGliese 876 d was discovered by analysing changes in its star's radial velocity as a result of the planet's gravity. The radial velocity measurements were made by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. At the time of discovery, Gliese 876 was known to host two extrasolar planets, designated Gliese 876 b and c, in a 2:1 orbital resonance. After the two planets were taken into account, the radial velocity still showed another period, at around two days. The planet, designated Gliese 876 d, was announced on June 13, 2005 by a team led by Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7.5 times that of Earth.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n \\n GJ 876 d Catalog\\n\\nGliese 876\\nAquarius (constellation)\\nExoplanets discovered in 2005\\nSuper-Earths\\nTerrestrial planets\\nExoplanets detected by radial velocity\\n8\",\n",
       "       'Gliese 86 (13 G. Eridani, HD 13445) is a K-type main-sequence star approximately 35 light-years away in the constellation of Eridanus.  It has been confirmed that a white dwarf orbits the primary star. In 1998 the European Southern Observatory announced that an extrasolar planet was orbiting the star.\\n\\nStellar components\\nThe primary companion (Gliese 86 A) is a K-type main-sequence star of spectral type K1V. The characteristics in comparison to our Sun are 83% the mass, 79% the radius, and 50% the luminosity. The star has a close-orbiting massive Jovian planet.\\n\\nGliese 86 B is a white dwarf located around 21 AU from the primary star, making the Gliese 86 system one of the tightest binaries known to host an extrasolar planet. It was discovered in 2001 and initially suspected to be a brown dwarf, but high contrast observations in 2005 suggested that the object is probably a white dwarf, as its spectrum does not exhibit molecular absorption features which are typical of brown dwarfs. Assuming the white dwarf has a mass about half that of our Sun and that the linear trend observed in radial velocity measurements is due to Gliese 86 B, a plausible orbit for this star around Gliese 86 A has a semimajor axis of 18.42 AU and an eccentricity of 0.3974. More precise measurements for the white dwarf give it a mass of 59% the mass of the Sun and a temperature of 8180K.\\n\\nPlanetary system\\nThe preliminary astrometric measurements made with the Hipparcos space probe suggest the planet has an orbital inclination of 164.0° and a mass 15 times Jupiter, which would make the object a brown dwarf. However, further analysis suggests the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to reliably determine astrometric orbits of substellar companions, thus the orbital inclination and true mass of the candidate planet remain unknown. It was discovered by the Swiss 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope operated by the Geneva Observatory.\\n\\nThe radial velocity measurements of Gliese 86 show a linear trend once the motion due to this planet are taken out. This may be associated with the orbital motion of the white dwarf companion.\\n\\nSee also\\n Map analysis of the 1961 Zeta Reticuli Incident\\n List of extrasolar planets\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n\\n \\nK-type main-sequence stars\\nWhite dwarfs\\nGliese, 0086\\nPlanetary systems with one confirmed planet\\n?\\nEridani, 13\\n010138\\n013445\\nDurchmusterung objects\\n0086\\n0637\\nTIC objects',\n",
       "       'Gliese 436 is a red dwarf approximately  away in the zodiac constellation of Leo. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 10.67, which is much too faint to be seen with the naked eye. However, it can be viewed with even a modest telescope of  aperture. In 2004, the existence of an extrasolar planet, Gliese 436b, was verified as orbiting the star. This planet was later discovered to transit its host star.\\n\\nProperties\\nGliese 436 is a M2.5V star, which means it is a red dwarf. Stellar models give an estimated size of about 42% of the Sun\\'s radius. The same model predicts that the outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 3,318\\xa0K, giving it the orange-red hue of an M-type star. Small stars such as this generate energy at a low rate, giving it only 2.5% of the Sun\\'s luminosity.\\n\\nGliese 436 is older than the Sun by several billion years and it has an abundance of heavy elements (with masses greater than helium-4) less than half% that of the Sun. The projected rotation velocity is 1.0\\xa0km/s, and the chromosphere has a low level of magnetic activity. Gliese 436 is a member of the \"old-disk population\" with velocity components in the galactic coordinate system of U=+44, V=−20 and W=+20\\xa0km/s.\\n\\nPlanetary system\\n\\nThe star is orbited by one known planet, designated Gliese 436 b. The planet has an orbital period of 2.6 Earth days and transits the star as viewed from Earth. It has a mass of 22.2 Earth masses and is roughly 55,000\\xa0km in diameter, giving it a mass and radius similar to the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune in the Solar System. In general, Doppler spectroscopy measurements do not measure the true mass of the planet, but instead measure the product m sin i, where m is the true mass and i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the line-of-sight and the normal to the planet\\'s orbital plane), a quantity that is generally unknown. However, for Gliese 436 b, the transits enable the determination of the inclination, as they show that the planet\\'s orbital plane is very nearly in the line of sight (i.e. that the inclination is close to 90 degrees). Hence the mass quoted is the actual mass. The planet is thought to be largely composed of hot ices with an outer envelope of hydrogen and helium, and is termed a \"hot Neptune\".\\n\\nGJ 436 b\\'s orbit is likely misaligned with its star\\'s rotation. In addition the planet\\'s orbit is eccentric. Because tidal forces would tend to circularise the orbit of the planet on short timescales, this suggested that Gliese 436 b is being perturbed by an additional planet orbiting the star.\\n\\nPossible second planet\\nIn 2008, a second planet, designated \"Gliese 436 c\" was claimed to have been discovered, with an orbital period of 5.2 days and an orbital semimajor axis of 0.045 AU. The planet was thought to have a mass of roughly 5 Earth masses and have a radius about 1.5 times larger than the Earth\\'s. Due to its size, the planet was thought to be a rocky, terrestrial planet. It was announced by Spanish scientists in April 2008 by analyzing its influence on the orbit of Gliese 436 b. Further analysis showed that the transit length of the inner planet is not changing, a situation which rules out most possible configurations for this system. Also, if it did orbit at these parameters, the system would be the only \"unstable\" orbit on UA\\'s Extrasolar Planet Interactions chart. The existence of this \"Gliese 436 c\" was thus regarded as unlikely, and the discovery was eventually retracted at the Transiting Planets conference in Boston, 2008.\\n\\nDespite the retraction, studies concluded that the possibility that there is an additional planet orbiting Gliese 436 remained plausible. With the aid of an unnoticed transit automatically recorded at NMSU on January 11, 2005, and observations by amateur astronomers, it has been suggested that there is a trend of increasing inclination of the orbit of Gliese 436 b, though this trend remains unconfirmed. This trend is compatible with a perturbation by a planet of less than 12 Earth masses on an orbit within about 0.08 AU of the star.\\n\\nTwo sub-Earth candidates\\nIn July 2012, NASA announced that astronomers at the University of Central Florida, using the Spitzer Space Telescope, strongly believed they had observed a second planet. This candidate planet was given the preliminary designation UCF-1.01, after the University of Central Florida. It was measured to have a radius of around two thirds that of Earth and, assuming an Earth-like density of 5.5 g/cm3, was estimated to have a mass of 0.3 times that of Earth and a surface gravity of around two thirds that of Earth. It orbits at 0.0185 AU from the star, every 1.3659 days. The astronomers also believe they have found some evidence for an additional planet candidate, UCF-1.02, which is of a similar size, though with only one detected transit its orbital period is unknown. Follow up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as a reanalysis of the Spitzer Space Telescope data were unable to confirm these planets.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nLeo (constellation)\\nM-type main-sequence stars\\n057087\\n0436\\n905\\nPlanetary transit variables\\nPlanetary systems with one confirmed planet\\nJ11421096+2642251'],\n",

       "array(['Grazing is a method of feeding in which a herbivore feeds on low-growing plants such as grasses or other multicellular organisms, such as algae. Many species of animals can be said to be grazers, from large animals such as hippopotamuses to small aquatic snails. Grazing behaviour is a type of feeding strategy within the ecology of a species. Specific grazing strategies include graminivory (eating grasses); coprophagy (producing part-digested pellets which are reingested); pseudoruminant (having a multi-chambered stomach but not chewing the cud); and grazing on plants other than grass, such as on marine algae.\\n\\nGrazing\\'s ecological effects can include redistributing nutrients, keeping grasslands open or favouring a particular species over another.\\n\\nEcology\\n\\nMany small selective herbivores follow larger grazers which skim off the highest, tough growth of grasses, exposing tender shoots. For terrestrial animals, grazing is normally distinguished from browsing in that grazing is eating grass or forbs, whereas browsing is eating woody twigs and leaves from trees and shrubs. Grazing differs from predation because the organism being grazed upon may not be killed. It differs from parasitism because the two organisms live together in a constant state of physical externality (i.e. low intimacy). Water animals that feed by rasping algae and other micro-organisms from stones are called grazers–scrapers.\\n\\nGraminivory\\n\\nGraminivory is a form of grazing involving feeding primarily on grass (specifically \"true\" grasses in the Poaceae). Horses, cattle, capybara, hippopotamuses, grasshoppers, geese, and giant pandas are graminivores. Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are obligate bamboo grazers, 99% of their diet consisting of sub-alpine bamboo species.\\n\\nCoprophagy\\n\\nRabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. They graze heavily and rapidly for about the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit remains outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. Their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem by using a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs and are immediately eaten (coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cattle and many other grazers) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.\\n\\nCapybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are herbivores that graze mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. As with other grazers, they can be very selective, feeding on the leaves of one species and disregarding other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. The capybara\\'s jaw hinge is not perpendicular; hence, it chews food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybara are coprophagous as a means of obtaining bacterial gut flora to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by a cow. As with other rodents, the front teeth of capybara grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.\\n\\nPseudoruminant\\n\\nThe hippopotamus is a large, semi-aquatic, mammal inhabiting rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity. Their incisors can be as long as 40\\xa0cm and the canines up to 50\\xa0cm; however, the canines and incisors are used for combat, and play no role in feeding. Hippos rely on their broad, horny lips to grasp and pull grasses which are then ground by the molars. The hippo is considered to be a pseudoruminant; it has a complex three- or four-chambered stomach but does not \"chew cud\".\\n\\nNon-grass grazing\\n\\nAlthough grazing is typically associated with mammals feeding on grasslands, ecologists sometimes use the word in a broader sense, to include any organism that feeds on any other species without ending the life of the prey organism. Use of the term \"grazing\" varies further; for example, a marine biologist may describe herbivorous sea urchins that feed on kelp as grazers, even when they kill the organism by cutting the plant at the base. Malacologists sometimes apply the word to aquatic snails that feed by consuming the microscopic film of algae, diatoms and detritus—a biofilm—that covers the substrate and other surfaces underwater. In marine ecosystems, grazing by mesograzers such as some crustaceans maintains habitat structure by preventing algal overgrowth, especially in coral reefs.\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nEnvironmental\\n\\nGrazer urine and feces \"recycle nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other plant nutrients and return them to the soil\". Grazing can allow for the accumulation of organic matter which may help to combat soil erosion. This acts as nutrition for insects and organisms found within the soil. These organisms \"aid in carbon sequestration and water filtration\".\\n\\nBiodiversity\\n\\nWhen grass is grazed, dead litter grass is reduced which is advantageous for birds such as waterfowl. Grazing can increase biodiversity. Without grazing, many of the same grasses grow, for example brome and bluegrass, consequently producing a monoculture.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\nEthology\\nHerbivory\\nLand use',\n",
       "       'Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction (symbiosis) in which members of one species gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed. This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms benefit from each other; amensalism, where one is harmed while the other is unaffected; parasitism, where one is harmed and the other benefits, and parasitoidism, which is similar to parasitism but the parasitoid has a free-living state and instead of just harming its host, it eventually ends up killing it. The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great structural adaptation consistent with its habits, as in the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Remoras feed on their hosts\\' fecal matter, while pilot fish feed on the leftovers of their hosts\\' meals. Numerous birds perch on bodies of large mammal herbivores or feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals.\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe word \"commensalism\" is derived from the word \"commensal\", meaning \"eating at the same table\" in human social interaction, which in turn comes through French from the Medieval Latin commensalis, meaning \"sharing a table\", from the prefix com-, meaning \"together\", and mensa, meaning \"table\" or \"meal\". Commensality, at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, refers to professors eating at the same table as students (as they live in the same \"college\").\\n\\nPierre-Joseph van Beneden introduced the term \"commensalism\" in 1876.\\n\\nExamples of commensal relationships \\nThe commensal pathway was traveled by animals that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received little benefit or harm. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the \\'tamer\\' individuals: less aggressive, with shorter fight-or-flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans and led to a domestic relationship.\\n\\nThe leap from a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, at which point the establishment of a reciprocal relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and then human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that includes another species with evolving behaviors.\\n\\nDogs\\nThe dog was the first domesticated animal, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before the cultivation of crops or the domestication of other animals. The dog is often hypothesised to be a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. Archaeological evidence, such as the Bonn-Oberkassel dog dating to ~14,000BP, supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture  and began close to the Last Glacial Maximum when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna.\\n\\nThe wolves more likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, and less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication.\\nProto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills. However, the extent to which proto-domestic wolves could have become dependent on this way of life prior to domestication and without human provisioning is unclear and highly debated. In contrast, cats may have become fully dependent on a commensal lifestyle before being domesticated by preying on other commensal animals, such as rats and mice, without any human provisioning. Debate over the extent to which some wolves were commensal with humans prior to domestication stems from debate over the level of human intentionality in the domestication process, which remains untested.\\n\\nThe earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.\\n\\nA mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Y-chromosome assessment of two wolf populations in North America combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Although these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence.\\n\\nA different study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these remains were derived from a population of specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.\\n\\nAspergillus and Staphylococcus\\n\\nNumerous genera of bacteria and fungi live on and in the human body as part of its natural flora. The fungal genus Aspergillus is capable of living under considerable environmental stress, and thus is capable of colonising the upper gastrointestinal tract where relatively few examples of the body\\'s gut flora can survive due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions produced by gastric acid and digestive juices. While Aspergillus normally produces no symptoms, in individuals who are immunocompromised or suffering from existing conditions such as tuberculosis, a condition called aspergillosis can occur, in which populations of Aspergillus grow out of control.\\n\\nStaphylococcus aureus, a common bacterial species, is known best for its numerous pathogenic strains that can cause numerous illnesses and conditions. However, many strains of S. aureus are metabiotic commensals, and are present on roughly 20 to 30% of the human population as part of the skin flora. S. aureus also benefits from the variable ambient conditions created by the body\\'s mucous membranes, and as such can be found in the oral and nasal cavities, as well as inside the ear canal. Other Staphylococcus species including S. warneri, S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis, will also engage in commensalism for similar purposes.\\n\\nNitrosomonas spp and Nitrobacter spp \\nCommensalistic relationships between microorganisms include situations in which the waste product of one microorganism is a substrate for another species. One good example is nitrification-the oxidation of ammonium ion to nitrate. Nitrification occurs in two steps: first, bacteria such as Nitrosomonas spp. and certain crenarchaeotes oxidize ammonium to nitrite; and second, nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by Nitrobacter spp. and similar bacteria. Nitrobacter spp. benefit from their association with Nitrosomonas spp. because they use nitrite to obtain energy for growth.\\n\\nCommensalistic associations also occur when one microbial group modifies the environment to make it better suited for another organism. The synthesis of acidic waste products during fermentation stimulates the proliferation of more acid-tolerant microorganisms, which may be only a minor part of the microbial community at neutral pH. A good example is the succession of microorganisms during milk spoilage. Biofilm formation provides another example. The colonization of a newly exposed surface by one type of microorganism (an initial colonizer) makes it possible for other microorganisms to attach to the microbially modified surface.\\n\\nArguments \\n\\nWhether the relationship between humans and some types of gut flora is commensal or mutualistic is still unanswered.\\n\\nSome biologists argue that any close interaction between two organisms is unlikely to be completely neutral for either party, and that relationships identified as commensal are likely mutualistic or parasitic in a subtle way that has not been detected. For example, epiphytes are \"nutritional pirates\" that may intercept substantial amounts of nutrients that would otherwise go to the host plant. Large numbers of epiphytes can also cause tree limbs to break or shade the host plant and reduce its rate of photosynthesis. Similarly, phoretic mites may hinder their host by making flight more difficult, which may affect its aerial hunting ability or cause it to expend extra energy while carrying these passengers.\\n\\nTypes \\n\\nLike all ecological interactions, commensalisms vary in strength and duration from intimate, long-lived symbioses to brief, weak interactions through intermediaries.\\n\\nPhoresy \\n\\nPhoresy is one animal attached to another exclusively for transport, mainly arthropods, examples of which are mites on insects (such as beetles, flies or bees), pseudoscorpions on mammals or beetles, and millipedes on birds. Phoresy can be either obligate or facultative (induced by environmental conditions).\\n\\nInquilinism \\n\\nInquilinism is the use of a second organism for permanent housing. Examples are epiphytic plants (such as many orchids) that grow on trees, or birds that live in holes in trees.\\n\\nMetabiosis \\n\\nMetabiosis is a more indirect dependency, in which one organism creates or prepares a suitable environment for a second. Examples include maggots, which develop on and infest corpses, and hermit crabs, which use gastropod shells to protect their bodies.\\n\\nSee also \\n Mutualism – where both organisms experience mutual benefit in the relationship\\n Parasitism – where one organism benefits at the expense of another organism.\\n Parabiosis – where both organisms occupy the same dwelling, but do not interfere with each other\\n Symbiosis – long-term interactions between different biological species, which can be mutualistic, commensal or parasitic\\n Synanthrope – species commensal with humans\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nBiological interactions\\nSymbiosis',\n",
       "       'A planktivore is an aquatic organism that feeds on planktonic food, including zooplankton and phytoplankton. Planktivorous organisms encompass a range of some of the planet\\'s smallest to largest multicellular animals in both the present day and in the past billion years; basking sharks and copepods are just two examples of giant and microscopic organisms that feed upon plankton. Planktivory can be an important mechanism of top-down control that contributes to trophic cascades in aquatic and marine systems. There is a tremendous diversity of feeding strategies and behaviors that planktivores utilize to capture prey. Some planktivores utilize tides and currents to migrate between estuaries and coastal waters; other aquatic planktivores reside in lakes or reservoirs where diverse assemblages of plankton are present, or migrate vertically in the water column searching for prey. Planktivore populations can impact the abundance and community composition of planktonic species through their predation pressure, and planktivore migrations facilitate nutrient transport between benthic and pelagic habitats.\\n\\nPlanktivores are an important link in marine and freshwater systems that connect primary producers to the rest of the food chain. As climate change causes negative effects throughout the global oceans, planktivores are often directly impacted through changes to food webs and prey availability. Additionally, harmful algal blooms (HABs) can negatively impact many planktivores and can transfer harmful toxins from the phytoplankton, to the planktivores, and along up the food chain. As an important source of revenue for humans through tourism and commercial uses in fisheries, many conservation efforts are going on globally to protect these diverse animals known as planktivores.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlankton and planktivory across taxonomic classes\\n\\nPhytoplankton: prey \\nPlankton are defined as any type of organism that is unable to swim actively against currents and are thus transported by the physical forcing of tides and currents in the ocean. Phytoplankton form the lowest trophic level of marine food webs and thus capture light energy and materials to provide food and energy for hundreds of thousands of types of planktivores. Because they require light and abundant nutrients, phytoplankton are typically found in surface waters where light rays can penetrate water. Nutrients that sustain phytoplankton include nitrate, phosphate, silicate, calcium, and micronutrients like iron; however, not all phytoplankton require all these identified nutrients and thus differences in nutrient availability impact phytoplankton species composition. This class of microscopic, photosynthetic organisms includes diatoms, coccolithophores, protists, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and other microscopic algae. Phytoplankton conduct photosynthesis via pigments in their cells; phytoplankton can use chlorophyll as well as other accessory photosynthetic pigments like fucoxanthin, chlorophyll c, alloxanthin, and carotenoids, depending on species. Due to their environmental requirements for light and nutrients, phytoplankton are most commonly found near continental margins, the equator, high-latitudes, and nutrient-rich areas.  They also form the foundation of the biological pump, which transports carbon to depth in the ocean.\\n\\nZooplankton: predators and prey \\nZooplankton (\"zoo\" meaning \"animal\") are generally consumers of other organisms for food. Zooplankton may consume either phytoplankton or other zooplankton, making them the smallest class of planktivores. They are common to most marine pelagic environments and act as an important step in the food chain to transfer energy up from primary producers to the rest of the marine food web. Some zooplankton remain planktonic for their entire lives, while others eventually grow large enough to swim against currents. For instance, fish are born as planktonic larvae but once they grow large enough to swim, they are no longer considered plankton. Many taxonomic groups (e.g. fishes, krill, corals, etc.) are zooplankton at some point in their lives. For example, oysters begin as planktonic larvae; during this stage when they are considered zooplankton, they consume phytoplankton. Once they mature to adulthood, oysters continue to consume phytoplankton. The spiny water flea is another example of a planktivorous invertebrate.\\n\\nSome of the largest communities of zooplankton exist in high latitude systems like the eastern Bering Sea; pockets of dense zooplankton abundance also exist in the California Current and the Gulf of Mexico. Zooplankton are, in turn, common prey items for planktivores; they respond to environmental change very rapidly due to their relatively short life spans, and so scientists can track their dynamics to understand what might be occurring in the larger marine food web and environment. The relative ratios of certain zooplankton in the larger zooplankton community can also indicate an environmental change (e.g., eutrophication) that may be significant. For instance, an increase in rotifer abundance in the Great Lakes has been correlated with abnormally high levels of nutrients (eutrophication).\\n\\nVertebrates: predators and prey \\n\\nMany fishes are planktivorous during all or part of their life cycles, and these planktivorous fish are important to human industry and as prey for other organisms in the environment like seabirds and piscivorous fishes. Planktivores comprise a large component of tropical ecosystems; in the Indo-Australian Archipelago, one study identified 350 planktivorous fish species in one studied grid cell and found that 27% of all fish species in this region were planktivorous. This global study found that coral reef habitats globally have a disproportionate amount of planktivorous fishes. In other habitats, examples of planktivorous fishes include many types of salmon like the pink salmon, sandeels, sardines, and silvery lightfish. In ancient systems (read more below), the Titanichthys was an early massive vertebrate pelagic planktivore, with a lifestyle similar to that of the modern basking, whale, and megamouth sharks, all of whom are also planktivores.\\n\\nSea birds can also be planktivores; least auklets, crested auklets, storm petrels, ancient auklets, phalaropes, and many penguins are all examples of avian planktivores. Planktivorous seabirds can be indicators of ecosystem status because their dynamics often reflect processes affecting many trophic levels, like the consequences of climate change. Blue whales and bowhead whales as well as some seals like the crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus) are also planktivorous. Blue whales were recently found to consume a vast amount more plankton than was previously understood, representing an important element of the ocean biogeochemical cycle.\\n\\nFeeding strategies \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, some plankton communities are well-studied and respond to environmental change very rapidly; understanding unusual plankton dynamics can elucidate potential consequences to planktivorous species and the larger marine food chain.\\n\\nOne well-studied planktivore species is the gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) which has a voracious appetite for various forms of plankton across its life cycle. Planktivores can be either obligate planktivores, meaning they can only feed on plankton, or facultative planktivores, which take plankton when available but eat other types of food as well. In the case of the gizzard shad, they are obligate planktivores when larvae and juveniles, in part due to their very small mouth size; larval gizzard shad are most successful when small zooplankton are present in adequate quantities within their habitat. As they grow, gizzard shad become omnivores, consuming phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger pieces of nutritious detritus. Adult gizzard shad consume large volumes of zooplankton until it becomes scarce, then start consuming organic debris instead. Larval fishes and blueback herring are other well-studied examples of obligate planktivores, whereas fishes like the ocean sunfish can alternate between plankton and other food sources (i.e., are facultative planktivores). Facultative planktivores tend to be more opportunistic and live in ecosystems with many types of food sources. Obligate planktivores have fewer options for prey choices; they are typically restricted to marine pelagic ecosystems that have a dominant plankton presence, such as highly productive upwelling regions.\\n\\nMechanics of consuming plankton \\n\\nPlanktivores, whether obligate or facultative, obtain food in multiple ways. Particulate feeders eat planktonic items selectively, by identifying plankton and pursuing them in the water column. Filter feeders process large volumes of water internally via different mechanisms, explained below, and strain food items out en masse or remove food particles from water as it passes by. \"Tow-net\" filter feeders swim rapidly with mouths open to filter the water, whereas \"pumping\" filter feeders suck in water via pumping actions. The charismatic flamingo is a pumping filter feeder, using its muscular tongue to pump water along specialized grooves in its bill and pump water back out once plankton have been retrieved. In a different filter feeding process, stationary animals, like corals, use their tentacles to grab plankton particles out of the water column and transfer the particles into their mouth. There are numerous interesting adaptations to remove plankton from the water column. The phalaropes use surface tension feeding to transport particles of prey to their mouth to be swallowed. These birds capture individual particles of plankton held in a droplet of water, suspended in their beaks. They then use a sequence of actions that begin with a quick opening of their beak to increase the surface area of the water droplet encasing prey. The action of stretching out the water droplet ultimately pushes the water and prey to the back of the throat where it can be consumed. These birds also spin around at the water surface, creating their own eddies that draw prey up closer to their beaks.\\n\\nSome species actively hunt plankton: in certain habitats such as the deep open ocean, as mentioned above, the planktivorous basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) track the movements of their prey closely up and down the water column. The megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios), another planktivorous species, adopts a similar feeding strategy that mirrors the movement in the water column of their planktonic prey. Similar to active hunting, some zooplankton, like copepods, are ambush hunters meaning they wait in the water column for prey to come within range and then rapidly attack and consume. Some fishes change their feeding strategy throughout their lives; the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) is an obligate filter feeder in early life stages, but matures into a particulate feeder. Some fishes, like the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) can merely modify their feeding behavior depending on the prey or environmental conditions. Some fishes also school together when feeding to help improve contact rates of plankton and simultaneously prevent themselves from predation. Some fishes have gill rakes, an internal filtration structure that assists fishes with capturing plankton prey. The amount of gill rakes can indicate planktivory as well as the typical size of plankton consumed, showing a correlation between gill rake structure and the consumed plankton type.\\n\\nNutritional value of plankton\\n\\nPlankton have highly variable chemical compositions, which impacts their nutritional quality as a food source. Scientists are still understanding how nutritional quality varies with the type of plankton; for example diatom nutritional quality is a controversial topic. The ratios of phosphorus and nitrogen to carbon within a given plankton determine its nutritional quality. More carbon in an organism relative to these two elements decreases the plankton\\'s nutritional value. Additionally, plankton with higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids are typically more energy dense.\\n\\nThe nutritional value of plankton does sometimes depend on the nutritional needs of the planktivorous species. For fishes, the nutritional value of plankton is dependent on docosahexaenoic acid, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid with higher concentrations of those chemicals leading to higher nutritional value. However, lipids in plankton prey are not the only required chemical for larval fish; Malzahn et al. found that other nutrients, like phosphorus, were necessary before growth improvements due to lipid concentrations can be realized. Additionally, it has been shown experimentally that the nutritional value of prey is more important than prey abundance for larval fishes. With climate change, plankton may decrease in nutritional quality. Lau et al. discovered that warming conditions and inorganic nutrient depletion in lakes as a result of climate change decreased the nutritional value of plankton communities.\\n\\nPlanktivory across ecological systems\\n\\nAncient systems \\n\\nPlanktivory is a common feeding strategy among some of our planet’s largest organisms in both the present and the past. Massive Mesozoic organisms like pachycormids have recently been identified as planktivores; some individuals of this group reached lengths upwards of 9 feet. Scientists also recently discovered the fossilized remains of another ancient organism, which they named the \"false megamouth\" (Pseudomegachasma) shark, and which was likely a filter-feeding planktivore during the Cretaceous period. This new discovery illuminated planktivory as an example of convergent evolution, whereby distinct lineages evolved to fulfill similar dietary niches. In other words, the false megamouth and its planktivory evolved separate from the ancestors of present-day shark planktivores like the megamouth shark, whale shark, and basking shark, all mentioned above.\\n\\nArctic systems \\n\\nThe Arctic supports productive ecosystems that include many types of planktivorous species. Planktivorous pink salmon are common in the Arctic and the Bering Strait and have been suggested to exert significant control on structuring the phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in the subarctic North Pacific. Shifts in prey type have also been observed: in northern Arctic regions, salmon are typically piscivorous (consuming other fish) while in the southern Arctic and Bering Strait they are planktivorous. Capelin, Mallotus villosus, are also distributed across much of the Arctic and can exert significant control on zooplankton populations as a result of their planktivorous diet. Capelin have also been seen to exhibit cannibalism on their eggs when other types of preferred plankton sources become less available; alternatively, this behavior may be because increased spawning leads to more eggs in the environment for consumption. Arctic cod are also important zooplankton consumers and appear to follow aggregations of zooplankton around the region. Planktivorous birds like the fork-tailed storm-petrel and many types of auklets are also very common in the Arctic. Little auks are the most common Arctic planktivore species; as they reproduce on land, their planktivory creates an important link between marine and terrestrial nutrient reserves. This link is formed as little auks consume plankton with marine-derived nutrients at sea, then deposit nutrient-rich waste products on land during their reproductive process.\\n\\nTemperate and sub-arctic systems \\nIn freshwater lake systems, planktivory can be an important forcer of trophic cascades which can ultimately affect phytoplankton production. Fishes, in these systems, can promote phytoplankton productivity by preying on the zooplankton that control phytoplankton abundances. This is an example of top-down trophic control, where higher trophic organisms like fishes impose control on the abundance of lower trophic organisms, like phytoplankton. Such control on primary production via planktivorous organisms can be important in the functioning of mid-western United States lake systems. Fishes are often the most impactful zooplankton predators, as seen in Newfoundland where three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) predate heavily upon zooplankton. In temperate lakes, the cyprinid and centrarchid fish families are commonly represented among the planktivore community. Planktivores can exert significant competition pressure on organisms in certain lake systems; for instance, in an Idaho lake the introduced planktivorous invertebrate shrimp Mysis relicta competes with the native landlocked planktivorous salmon kokanees. Because of the salmon\\'s importance in trophic cycling, the loss of fishes in temperate lake systems could lead to widespread ecological consequences; in this example, such a loss could lead to unchecked predation on plankton by Mysis relicta. Planktivory can also be important in man-made reservoirs. In contrast to deeper and colder natural lakes, reservoirs are warmer, shallower, heavily-modified human made systems with different ecosystem dynamics. Gizzard shad, the previously mentioned obligate planktivore, is frequently the most common fish in many reservoir systems.\\n\\nIn certain sub-Arctic habitats like deep waters, the planktivorous basking shark tracks the movements of their prey closely up and down the water column in deep waters. Other species like the megamouth shark adopt a similar feeding strategy that mirrors movement in the water column of their plankton prey. In sub-Arctic lakes, certain morphs of the whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) are planktivorous; the pelagic whitefish feeds primarily on zooplankton and as such have more gill rakers for enhanced feeding than other, non-planktivorous morphs of the same species.\\n\\nNutrient limitation in lake systems \\nThe primary limiting nutrient shifts between nitrogen and phosphorus; a resulting consequence of changes in the structure of the food-web, thus limiting primary and secondary production in aquatic ecosystems. The bioavailability of such nutrients drives variation in the biomass and productivity of planktonic species. Due to variance in the N:P excretion of planktivorous fish species, consumer-driven nutrient cycling results in changes in nutrient availability. By feeding on zooplankton, planktivorous fish can increase the rate of nutrient recycling by releasing phosphorus from their prey. Planktivorous fish may release cyanobacteria from nutrient limitation by increasing the concentration of bioavailable phosphorus through excretion. The presence of planktivorous fish can disturb sediments, resulting in an increase in the amount of nutrients that are bioavailable to phytoplankton and further support in phytoplankton nutrient demands.\\n\\nPlanktivore effects on a global scale\\n\\nTrophic regulation \\nPlanktivory can play an important role in the growth, abundance, and community composition of planktonic species via top-down trophic control. For example, competitive superiority of large zooplankton over smaller species in lake systems leads to large-body dominance in the absence of planktivorous fish as a result of increased food availability and grazing efficiency. Alternatively, the presence of planktivorous fish results in a decrease in zooplankton population through predation and shifts the community composition towards smaller zooplankton by limiting food availability and influencing size-selective predation (see the “predation” page for more information regarding size-selective predation). Predation by planktivorous fish reduces grazing by zooplankton and subsequently increases phytoplankton primary production and biomass. By limiting the population and growth rate of zooplankton, obligate zooplanktivores are less likely to migrate to the area due to the lack of available food. For example, the presence of gizzard shad in reservoirs has been observed to strongly influence the recruitment of other planktivores. Variations of fish recruitment and mortality rates from nutrient limitation have also been noted in lake ecosystems.\\n\\nPiscivory can have similar top-down effects on planktonic species by influencing the community composition of planktivores. The population of planktivorous fish can also be influenced through predation by piscivorous species such as marine mammals and aquatic birds. For example, planktivorous minnows in Lake Gatun experienced a rapid population decline after the introduction of peacock bass (Cichla ocellaris). However, a reduced population of planktivorous fish species result in a population increase of another class of planktivores – zooplankton. In lake ecosystems, some fish have been observed to behave first as zooplanktivores then as piscivores, affecting cascading trophic interactions.\\n\\nPlanktivory pressure from zooplankton in marine communities (top-down control, as previously mentioned)has a large influence on phytoplankton productivity. Zooplankton can control phytoplankton seasonal dynamics as they exert the largest grazing pressure on phytoplankton; they also may modify their grazing strategies depending on environmental conditions, leading to seasonal change. For instance, copepods can switch between ambushing prey and using water flow to capture prey depending on external conditions and prey abundance. The planktivorous pressure zooplankton exert could explain the diversity of phytoplankton despite many phytoplankton occupying similar ecological niches (see the “paradox of the plankton” page for more information regarding this ecological conundrum).\\n\\nOne notable example of trophic control is how planktivores have the ability to impact the species distribution of larval crabs in estuaries and coastal waters. Crab larvae, which are also planktivores, are hatched inside estuaries but some species then begin their migration out to waters along the coast where there are not as many predators. These crab larvae then utilize the tides to return to the estuaries when they become benthic organisms and are no longer planktivores. Planktivores tend to live their early lives within estuaries. These juvenile fish tend to inhabit these regions throughout the warmer months in the year. Throughout the year, the risk for plankton varies within estuaries, the risk reaches its highest from August to October, and the lowest from December to April, this is consistent with the theory that planktivory is the highest in the summer months in this system. The risk of planktivory is strongly correlated with the number of planktivores within this system.\\n\\nNutrient transport \\nConsumers can regulate primary production in an ecosystem by altering ratios of nutrients via different rates of recycling. Nutrient transport is greatly influenced by planktivorous fish, which recycle and transport nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats. Nutrients released by benthic-feeding fishes can increase the total nutrient content of pelagic waters, as transported nutrients are fundamentally different from those that are recycled. Additionally, planktivorous fish can have significant effect on nutrient transport as well as total nutrient concentration by disturbing sediments through bioturbation. Increased nutrient cycling from near-sediment bioturbation by filter-feeding planktivores can increase phytoplankton population via nutrient enrichment. Salmon accumulate marine nutrients as they mature in ocean environments which they then transport back to their stream of origin to spawn. As they decompose, the freshwater streams become enriched with nutrients which contribute to the development of the ecosystem.\\n\\nThe physical transport of nutrients and plankton can greatly affect the community composition and food web structure within oceanic ecosystems. In nearshore regions, planktivores and piscivores have been shown to be highly sensitive to changes in ocean currents while zooplankton populations are unable to tainted levels of predation pressure.\\n\\nPlanktivore modification on plankton growth \\nIn some marine systems, planktivory can be an important factor controlling the duration and extent of phytoplankton blooms. Changes in phytoplankton communities and growth rates can modify the amount of grazing pressure present; grazing pressure can also be dampened by physical factors in the water column. The scientist Michael Behrenfeld proposed that the deepening of the mixed layer in the ocean, a vertical region near the surface made physically and chemically homogenous by active mixing, leads to a decrease in grazing interactions among planktivores and plankton because planktivores and plankton become more spatially distant from one another. This spatial distance thereby facilitates phytoplankton blooms and ultimately grazing rates by planktivores; both the physical changes and changes to grazing pressure have a significant influence on where and when phytoplankton blooms occur. The shallowing of the mixed layer due to physical processes within the water column conversely intensifies planktivore feeding.\\n\\nHarmful algal blooms \\n\\nHarmful algal blooms occur when there is a bloom of toxin producing phytoplankton. Planktivores such as fish and filter feeders that are present have a high likelihood of consuming these phytoplankton because that is what makes up the majority of their diet, or the diet of their prey. Since these planktivores near the bottom of the food chain consume harmful toxins, those toxins then move up the food web when predators consume these fish. The increasing concentration of some toxins through trophic levels presented here is called bioaccumulation, and this can lead to a range of impacts from non-lethal changes in behavior to major die-offs of large marine animals. There are monitoring programs in place for shellfish due to human health concerns and the ease of sampling in oysters. Some fish feed directly on phytoplankton, like the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and Clupeidae, while other fish feed on zooplankton that consume the harmful algae. Domoic acid is a toxin carried by a type of diatom called Pseudo-nitzschia. Pseudo-nitzchia were the main organism responsible for a large HAB that took place along the west coast of the US in 2015 and had a large impact on the Dungeness crab fishery that year. When harmful algal blooms occur, planktivorous fish can act as vectors for poisonous substances like domoic acid. These planktivorous fish are eaten by larger fish and birds and the subsequent ingestion of toxins can then harm those species. Those animals consume planktivorous fish during a harmful algal bloom, and can have miscarriages, seizures, vomiting, and can sometimes die. Additionally, marine mammal mortality is occasionally attributed to harmful algal blooms, according to NOAA.\\n\\nKrill are another example of a planktivore that may exhibit high levels of domoic acid in their system; these large plankton are then consumed by humpback and blue whales. Since krill can have such a high level of domoic acid in their system when blooms are present, that concentration is rapidly transferred to whales which leads them to have a high concentration of domoic acid in their system as well. There is no evidence proving that this domoic acid has had a negative impact on the whales, but if the concentration of domoic acid is great enough, they could be impacted similarly to other marine mammals.\\n\\nThe role of climate change \\nClimate change is a worldwide phenomenon that affects everything from the largest planktivores such as whales, to even the smallest plankton. Climate change affects weather patterns, creates seasonal anomalies, alters sea surface temperature, alters ocean currents, and can affect nutrient availability for phytoplankton, and may even spur HABs in some systems.\\n\\nArctic and Antarctic \\n\\nThe Arctic has been hit hard with shorter winters and hotter summers creating less permafrost and rapidly melting ice caps causing lower salinity levels. The coupling of higher ocean CO2 levels, temperatures, and lower salinity is causing changes in phytoplankton communities and diatom diversity.Thalassiosira spp. Plankton was replaced by solitary Cylindrotheca closterium or Pseudo-nitzschia spp. , a common HAB causing phytoplankton, under higher temperature and lower salinity in combination. Community changes such as this one, have large-scale effects through trophic levels. A shift in the primary producer communities can cause shifts in consumer communities, as the new food may provide different dietary benefits. As there is less permanent ice in the Arctic and less summer ice, some planktivores species are already moving north into these new open waters. Atlantic Cod and orcas have been documented in these new territories, while planktivores such as Arctic cod are losing their habitat and feeding grounds under and around the sea ice. Similarly, the Arctic birds, the Least and Crested Auklets rely on zooplankton that lives under the disappearing sea ice and has seen dramatic effects on reproductive fitness and nutrition stress with the decreasing amounts of zooplankton available in the Bering Sea basin.\\n\\nIn another prime example of shifting food webs, Moore et al. (2018) have found a shift from benthic dominated ecosystem to a more pelagic dominated ecosystem feeding structure. With longer open water periods, due to a loss of sea ice the Chukchi Sea has seen a shift in the past three decades. The increase in air temperature and loss of sea ice have coupled to promote an increase in pelagic fishes and a decrease in benthic biomass. This shift has encouraged a shift to planktivorous seabirds instead of piscivorous seabirds.\\n\\nPollock fish are a planktivorous fish that rely on copepods as their primary diet as juveniles. According to the Oscillating Control Hypothesis, early ice retreat caused by a warming climate creates a later bloom of copepods and aphids (a plankton species). The later bloom produces fewer large lipid rich copepods, and results in smaller less nutrient rich copepods. The older pollock then face a winter starvation, causing carnivory on young pollock (<1yr old), and reduced population numbers and fitness.\\n\\nSimilar to the Arctic, sea ice in the Antarctic is melting rapidly and permanent ice is becoming less and less (Zachary Lab Cite). This ice melt creates changes in freshwater input and\\xa0 ocean stratification, consequently affecting nutrient delivery to primary producers. As sea ice recedes, there is less valuable surface area for algae to grow on the bottom of the ice. This lack of algae inhibits krill (a partial planktonic species) to have less food availability, consequently affecting the fitness of Antarctic primary consumers such as krill, squid, pollock, and other carnivorous zooplankton.\\n\\nSubarctic \\nThe Subarctic has seen similar ecosystem changes especially in well studied places such as Alaska. The warmer waters have helped increase zooplankton communities and have been creating a shift in ecosystem dynamics (Green 2017). There has been a large shift from piscivorous seabirds such as pacific loons and black-legged kittiwakes to planktivores sea birds such as Ancient Auklets and Short-tailed Shearwaters. Marine planktivores such as the charismatic humpback, fin, and minke whales have been benefiting from the increase in zooplankton such as an increase in krill. As these large whales spend more time migrating into these northern water, they are taking up resources previously only used by arctic planktivores, creating potential shifts in food availability and thus food webs.\\n\\nTropics \\nTropical and equatorial marine regions are mainly characterized by coral reef communities or vast open oceans. Coral reefs are one of the most susceptible ecosystems to climate change, in particular the symptoms of warming oceans and acidification. Ocean acidification raises CO2 levels in the ocean and has significant effects on zooplankton communities. Smith et al. (2016) discovered that increased levels of CO2 show reductions in zooplankton biomass but not zooplankton quality in tropical ecosystems, as increased CO2 had no negative effects on fatty acid compositions. This means that planktivores are not receiving less nutritious zooplankton, but are experiencing lesser availability of zooplankton than is needed for survival.\\n\\nOne of the most important planktivores in the tropics are corals themselves. Although spending a portion of their life cycle as planktonic organisms themselves, established corals are sedentary organisms that can use their tentacles to capture plankton from the surrounding environment to help supplement energy produced by the photosynthetic zooxanthellae. Climate change has had significant impacts on coral reefs, with warming causing coral bleaching and increases in infectious diseases, sea-level rise causing more sedimentation that then smothers corals, stronger and more frequent storms causing breakage and structural destruction, an increase of land runoff bringing more nutrients into the systems causing algal blooms that murk up the water and therefore diminish light availability for photosynthesis, altered ocean currents causing a difference in the dispersal of larvae and planktonic food availability, and lastly changes in ocean pH decreasing structural integrity and growth rates.\\n\\nThere is also a plethora of planktivorous fish throughout the tropics that play important ecological roles within marine systems. Similar to corals, planktivorous reef fish are directly affected by these changing systems and these negative effects then disrupt food webs through the oceans. As plankton communities shift in speciation and availability, primary consumers have a harder time meeting energy budgets. This lack of food availability can influence reproductivity and overall primary consumer populations, creating food shortages for higher trophic consumers.\\n\\nEffects of planktivores on industry \\n\\nThe global fisheries industry is a multi-billion dollar, international industry that provides food and livelihoods to billions of people around the globe. Some\\xa0 of the most important fisheries include salmon, pollock, mackerel, char, cod, halibut, and trout. In 2021, the take home total profits, before bonuses, actually going into fishermen\\'s pockets, from the Alaskan salmon, cod, flounder, and groundfish fishing season came to $248 million dollars. Planktivorous fish alone create an important, large economic industry. In 2017 Alaska pollock was the United State’s largest commercial fishery by volume with 3.4 billion pounds being caught and coming in at total value of $413 million dollars.\\n\\nBesides fishing, planktivorous marine animals drive tourism economy as well. Tourist travel across the world for whale watching, to see charismatic megafauna such as humpback whales in Hawaii, Minke whales in Alaska, grey whales in Oregon, and whale sharks in South America. Manta rays also drive dive and snorkel tourism, raking in over $73 million dollars annually, in direct revenue, over 23 countries around the world.&& The main participating countries in Manta ray tourism include Japan, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mozambique, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, United States, Federated States of Micronesia and Palau.\\n\\nSee also \\n Zooplankton\\n Plankton\\n Piscivore\\n Phytoplankton\\n Filter feeder\\n Carnivore\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nEcology terminology\\nAnimals by eating behaviors\\nLimnology',\n",
       "       'Cutaneous respiration, or cutaneous gas exchange (sometimes called, skin breathing), is a form of respiration in which gas exchange occurs across the skin or outer integument of an organism rather than gills or lungs. Cutaneous respiration may be the sole method of gas exchange, or may accompany other forms, such as ventilation. Cutaneous respiration occurs in a wide variety of organisms, including insects, amphibians, fish, sea snakes, turtles, and to a lesser extent in mammals.\\n\\nPhysical constraints\\nGas exchange in cutaneous respiration is controlled by three factors: \\nVentilation: the rate of delivery of respiratory medium (water or air) to the respiratory surface\\nDiffusion: the passage of gases through the skin\\nConvection: the carrying of dissolved gases towards or away from the lungs\\n\\nTaxonomic diversity in chordates\\n\\nFish \\nCutaneous respiration occurs in a variety of marine, intertidal, and freshwater fish. For aquatic respiration, fish respire primarily via gills but cutaneous respiration may account for 5 to 40 percent of the total respiration, depending on species and temperature. Cutaneous respiration is more important in species that breathe air, such as mudskippers and reedfish, and in such species may account for almost 50 percent of total respiration.\\n\\nAmphibians \\n\\nThe skin of amphibians is a major site of respiration in all species for which measurements are available. Cutaneous respiration is the sole respiratory mode of lungless salamanders (family Plethodontidae) which lack lungs entirely yet constitute the largest family of salamanders. Cutaneous respiration in frogs and other amphibians may be the primary respiratory mode during colder temperatures. \\n\\nSome amphibians utilizing cutaneous respiration have extensive folds of skin to increase the rate of respiration. Examples include the hellbender salamander and the Lake Titicaca water frog. Cutaneous respiration in hellbenders accounts for more than 90 percent of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion.\\n\\nReptiles \\nBeing covered in scales largely precludes cutaneous respiration in reptiles, but gas exchange may occur between scales or areas with reduced scales. Some turtles rely on cutaneous respiration from around the cloaca during underwater hibernation.\\n\\nIn some sea snakes, cutaneous respiration can account for up to 30 percent of total oxygen uptake and is important when diving, during which blood is shunted away from the lungs and towards capillaries in the skin, in some cases causing the skin to turn pink.\\n\\nMammals \\nMammals are endotherms, (\"warm-blooded\") and have higher metabolic demands than ectothermic (\"cold-blooded\") vertebrates, and the skin is thicker and more impermeable than other vertebrates, which preclude the skin as a major source of gas exchange. However, small amounts of respiration may occur, and in bats, the highly vascularized wings may account for up to 12 percent of carbon dioxide excretion. In humans and most other mammals, cutaneous respiration accounts for only 1 to 2 percent.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n Enteral respiration\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRespiration\\nSkin',\n",
       "       \"Overpopulation or overabundance is a phenomenon that occurs when a species’ population becomes larger than the carrying capacity of its environment. This may occur from increased birth rates, less predation or lower mortality rates, and large scale migration. As a result, the overpopulated species as well as other animals in the ecosystem begin to compete for food, space, and resources. The animals in an overpopulated area may then be forced to migrate to areas not typically inhabited, or die off without access to necessary resources.\\n\\nBackground \\nIn ecology, overpopulation is a concept used primarily in wildlife management. Typically, an overpopulation causes the entire population of the species in question to become weaker, as no single individual is able to find enough food or shelter. As such, overpopulation is thus characterized by an increase in the diseases and parasite-load which live upon the species in question, as the entire population is weaker. Other characteristics of overpopulation are lower fecundity, adverse effects on the environment (soil, vegetation or fauna) and lower average body weights. Especially the worldwide increase of deer populations, which usually show irruptive growth, is proving to be of ecological concern. Ironically, where ecologists were preoccupied with conserving or augmenting deer populations only a century ago, the focus has now shifted in the direct opposite, and ecologists are now more concerned with limiting the populations of such animals.\\n\\nSupplemental feeding of charismatic species or interesting game species is a major problem in causing overpopulation, as is too little hunting or trapping of such species. Management solutions are increasing hunting by making it easier or cheaper for (foreign) hunters to hunt, banning supplemental feeding, awarding bounties, forcing landowners to hunt or contract professional hunters, using immunocontraception, promoting the harvest of venison or other wild meats, introducing large predators (rewilding), poisonings or introducing diseases.\\n\\nA useful tool in wildlife culling is the use of mobile freezer trailers in which to store carcasses. The harvest of meat from wild animals is a sustainable method of creating a circular economy.\\n\\nImmunocontraception is a non-lethal method of regulating wild-animal population growth. \\u200b\\u200bImmunocontraception has been successfully used or tested in a variety of wild-animal populations including those of bison, deer, elephants, gray squirrels, pigeons, rats and wild horses. Among the limitations of injectable immunocontraceptives are a relatively long time between vaccine administration and a reduction in population size (although stabilization of population size occurs faster) and the need to be in close proximity with animals for injection. Oral vaccines do not have the latter limitation, but they are still not as well developed as injectable vaccines.\\n\\nWell studied species\\n\\nDeer \\nIn Scotland the program of having landowners privately cull the overpopulation of red deer in the highlands has proved an abject failure. Scotland's deer are stunted, emaciated, and frequently starve in the Spring. As of 2016 the population is now so high, that 100,000 deer would need to be culled each year only to maintain the current population. A number of landowners have proven unwilling to accede to the law, requiring government intervention anyway. It has been necessary to contract professional hunters in order to satisfy landowner legislation regarding the annual cull. Millions of pounds of taxpayers' cash is spent on the annual cull. As of 2020, 100,000 deer are shot each year. Compounding the problem, some landowners have used supplemental feeding at certain shooting blinds in order to ease sport hunting.\\n\\nOverpopulation can have effects on forage plants, eventually causing a species to thus alter the greater environment. Natural ecosystems are extremely complex. The overpopulation of deer in Britain has been caused by legislation making hunting more difficult, but another reason may be the proliferation of forests, used by different deer species to breed and shelter. Forests and parks have caused Britain to be much more forested than it was in recent history, and may thus perversely be causing biodiversity loss, conversion of heath habitat to grassland, extirpation of grassland and woodland plants due to overgrazing and the changing of the habitat structure. Examples are bluebells and primroses. Deer open up the forest and reduce the amount of brambles, which then has knock-on effects on dormice and certain birds which nest near the ground, such as the capercaillie, dunnock, nightingale, song thrush, willow warbler, marsh tit, willow tit and bullfinch. Populations of the nightingale and the European turtle dove are believed to be primarily impacted by muntjac. Grouse populations suffer due to smashing into the fencing needed to protect against deer.\\n\\nA significant amount of the environmental destruction in Britain is caused by an overabundance of deer. Besides ecological effects, overpopulation of deer causes economic effects due to browsing on crops, expensive fencing needed to combat this and protect new afforestation planting and coppice growth, and increasing numbers of road traffic incidents. Deer are in fact the most lethal animals of Britain, killing approximately 20 people a year from road accidents. In Scotland, the cost of road accidents due to these animals is estimated to be £7 million, and such collisions cause injuries to 50 to 100 people a year. High populations cause stripping of the bark of trees, eventually destroying forests. Protecting forests from deer costs on average three times as much as planting the forest in the first place. The NGO Trees for Life spent weeks planting native trees in Scotland, aiming to rebuild the ancient Caledonian Forest. After winter snowdrifts in 2014/2015 flattened the deer fences, more than a decade's growth was lost in a matter of weeks. In 2009 – 2010 the cost of forest protection in Scotland ran to £10.5m.\\n\\nSome animals, such as muntjac, are too small and boring for most hunters to shoot, which poses additional management problems.\\n\\nIn the United States the exact same problem is seen with white-tailed deer, where populations have exploded and become invasive species in some areas. In continental Europe roe deer pose a similar problem, although the populations were formerly much less, they have swelled in the 20th century so that although two and a half million are shot each year by hunters in Western Europe alone, as of 1998, the population still appears to be increasing, causing problems for forestry and traffic. In an experiment where roe deer on a Norwegian island was freed from human harvest and predators, the deer showed a doubling of the population each year or two. In the Netherlands and southern England roe deer were extirpated from the entirety of the country except for a few small areas around 1875. In the 1970s the species was still completely absent from Wales, but as of 2013, it has colonized the entire country. As new forests were planted in the Netherlands in the 20th century, the population began to expand rapidly. As of 2016 there are some 110,000 deer in the country.\\n\\nBirds\\nAquaculture operations, recreation angling and populations of endangered fish such as the schelly are impacted by cormorant populations. Open aquaculture ponds provide winter or year-round homes and food for cormorants. Cormorants' effect on the aquaculture industry is significant, with a dense flock capable of consuming an entire harvest. Cormorants are estimated to cost the catfish industry in Mississippi alone between $10 million and $25 million annually. Cormorant culling is commonly achieved by sharp-shooting, nest destruction, roost dispersal and oiling the eggs.\\n\\nGeese numbers have also been called overpopulated. In the Canadian Arctic region, snow geese, Ross's geese, greater white-fronted geese and some populations of Canada geese have been increasing significantly over the past decades. Lesser snow geese populations have increased to over three million, and continue to increase by some 5% per year. Giant Canada geese have grown from near extinction to nuisance levels. Average body sizes have decreased and parasite loads are higher. Before the 1980s, Arctic geese populations had boom and bust cycles (see above) thought to be based on food availability, although there are still some bust years, this no longer seems the case.\\n\\nIt is difficult to know what the numbers of geese were before the 20th century, before human impact presumably altered them. There are a few anecdotal claims from that time of two or three million, but these are likely exaggerations, as that would imply a massive die-off or vast amounts harvested, for which there is no evidence. More likely estimates from the period of 1500 to 1900 are a few hundred thousand animals, which implies that with the exception of Ross's geese, modern populations of geese are many millions more than in pre-industrial levels.\\n\\nHumans are blamed as the ultimate cause for the increase, directly and indirectly, due to management legislation limiting hunting introduced specifically in order to protect bird populations, but most importantly due to the increase in agriculture and large parks, which has had the effect of creating vast amounts of unintentional sanctuaries filled with food. Urban geese flocks have increased enormously. City ordinances generally prohibit discharging firearms, keeping such flocks safe, and there is abundant food. Geese profit from agricultural grain crops, and seem to be shifting their habitat preferences to such farmlands. Ironically, the creation of wildlife refuges may have exacerbated this: as geese overpopulations destroyed the Scirpus salt marsh habitats that they were originally restricted to, this has speeded their conversion to adopt new feeding habitats, while maintaining roosting sites in refuges. The creation of wildlife refuges to protect wetland habitats in the continental United States from the 1930s to 1950s seems to have had the effect of disrupting the migration routes, as geese no longer fly as far south to Texas and Louisiana as they once did. Reduction of goose hunting in the US since the 1970s seems to have further had the effect of protecting populations. In Canada hunting has also decreased dramatically, from 43.384% harvest rates in the 1960s to 8% in the 1990s. Nonetheless, when kill rates were compared to populations, hunting alone does not seems to be solely responsible for the increase -weather or a not yet completed shift in habitat preference to agricultural land may also be factors. Although hunting may have formerly been the main factor in maintaining stable populations, ecologists no longer consider it a practical management solution, as public interest in the practice has continued to wane, and the population is now so large that the massive culls needed are unrealistic to ask from the public. Climate change in the Arctic would appear to be an obvious cause for the increase, but when subpopulations are correlated with local climatic increases, this does not seem to hold true, and furthermore, breeding regions seem to be shifting southwards anyway, irrespective of climate change.\\n\\nThe nutrient subsidy provided by foraging in agricultural land has made the overall landscape use by geese unsustainable. Where such geese congregate local plant communities have been substantially altered; these chronic effects are cumulative, and have been considered a threat to the Arctic ecosystems, due to knock-off effects on native ducks, shorebirds and passerines. Grubbing and overgrazing by geese completely denudes the tundra and marshland, in combination with abiotic processes, this creates large desert expanses of hypersaline, anoxic mud which continue to increase each year -eventually these habitat changes become irreversible remaining in this state for decades. Biodiversity drops to only one or two species which are inedible for geese, such as Senecio congestus, Salicornia borealis and Atriplex hastata. Because grazing occurs in serial stages, with biodiversity decreasing at each stage, floral composition may be used as an indicator of the degree of goose foraging at a site. Other effects are destruction of the vegetation holding dunes in place, the shift from sedge meadows and grassy swards with herbaceous plants to moss fields, which can eventually give way to bare ground called 'peat barrens', and the erosion of this bare peat until glacial gravel and till is bared. In the High Arctic research is less developed: Eriophorum scheuchzeri and E. angustifolium fens appear to be affected, and are being replaced by carpets of moss, whereas meadows covered in Dupontia fisheri appear to be escaping destruction. There does not appear to be the damage found at lower latitudes in the Arctic. There is little proper research in effects on other birds. The yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) appears to be extirpated from areas of Manitoba due habitat loss caused by the geese, whereas on the other hand the semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) appears to be taking advantage of the large areas of dead willows as a breeding ground.\\n\\nIn the wintering grounds in continental USA, effects are much less pronounced. Experimentally excluding geese by means of fencing in North Carolina has found heavily affected areas can regenerate after only two years. Bulrush stands (Schoenoplectus americanus) are still an important component of the diet, but there are indications the bulrush is being impacted, with soft mudflats gradually replacing areas where it grows.\\n\\nDamage to agriculture is primarily to seedlings, winter wheat and hay production. Changing the species composition to species less palatable to geese, such as Lotus may alleviate losses in hay operations. Geese also feed on agricultural land without causing economic loss, gleaning seeds from corn, soya or other grains and feeding on wheat, potato and corn stubble. In Québec crop damage insurance for the hay industry began in 1992 and claims increased yearly; actual compensation paid by the government, including administrative costs, amount to some half a million dollars a year.\\n\\nThe fact that Arctic regions are remote, there is little public understanding for combatting the problem, and ecologists as yet do not have any effective solutions for combatting the problem anyway. In Canada, the most important hunters of geese are the Cree people around Hudson Bay, members of the Mushkegowuk Harvesters Association, with an average kill rate of up to 60.75 birds per species per hunter in the 1970s. Kill rates have dropped, with hunters taking only half as much in the 1990s. However, total numbers of kills have increased, i.e. there are more hunters, but they are killing less per person. Nonetheless, per household the kills are approximately the same, at 100 birds. This indicates that stimulating an increase in native hunting might be difficult to achieve. The Cree population has increased. Elders say the taste of the birds has gotten worse, and they are thinner, both possibly effects due to the overpopulation. Elders also say that hunting has gotten more difficult, because there are less young and goslings, which are more likely to fall for decoys. Inuit peoples and other peoples to the north do much less hunting of geese, with kill rates of 1 to 24 per species per hunter. Per kilogram, hunters save some $8.14 to $11.40 from buying poultry at stores. Total kill numbers from hunters elsewhere in the USA and southern Canada has been falling steadily. This is blamed on a decline in people interested in hunting, more feeding areas for the birds, and larger flocks with more experienced adult birds which makes decoying difficult. Individual hunters are bagging higher numbers, compensating lower hunter numbers.\\n\\nManagement strategies in the USA include increasing the bag limit and the number of open hunting days, goose egg addling, trapping and relocation, and egg and nest destruction, managing habitat to make it less attractive to geese, harassment and direct culling. In Denver, Colorado, during moulting season biologists rounded up 300Canada geese (of 5,000 in the city), ironically on Canada Day, killing them and distributing the meat to needy families (as opposed to sending it to a landfill), to try to curb the number of geese, following such programs in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Maryland. Complaints about the birds were that they had taken over the golf courses, pooped all over the place, devoured native plants and scared citizens. Such culls have proven socially controversial, with intense backlash by some citizens. Park officials had tried dipping eggs in oil, using noise-makers and planting tall plants, but this was not sufficient.\\n\\nIn Russia, the problem does not seem to exist, likely due to human harvest and local long-term cooling climate trends in the Russian Far East and Wrangel Island.\\n\\nIt is also possible that the population growth is completely natural, and that when the carrying capacity of the environment is reached the population will stop growing. For organisations such as Ducks Unlimited, the resurgence of goose populations in North America can be called one of the greatest success story in wildlife management. By 2003 the US goose harvest was approaching 4 million, three times the numbers 30 years ago.\\n\\nPets \\nIn the United States, over half of the households own a dog or a cat. Even with so much pet ownership there is still an issue with pet overpopulation, especially seen in shelters. Because of this problem it is estimated that between 10 and 25 percent of dogs and cats are killed yearly. The animals are killed humanely, but the goal is to greatly lower and eventually completely avoid this. Estimating the overpopulation of pets, especially cats and dogs, is a difficult task, but it has been a continuous problem. It has been hard to determine the number of shelters and animals in each shelter around even just the US. Animals are constantly being moved around or euthanized, so it is difficult to keep track of those numbers across the country. It is becoming universally agreed upon that sterilization is a tool that can help reduce population size so that less offspring are produced in the future With less offspring, pet populations can start to decrease which reduces the amount that get killed each year.\\n\\nPopulation cycles\\n\\nIn the wild, rampant population growth of prey species often causes growth in the populations of predators. Such predator-prey relationships can form cycles, which are usually mathematically modelled as Lotka–Volterra equations.\\n\\nIn natural ecosystems, predator population growth lags just behind the prey populations. After the prey population crashes, the overpopulation of predators causes the entire population to be subjected to mass starvation. The population of the predator drops, as less young are able to survive into adulthood. This could be considered a perfect time for wildlife managers to allow hunters or trappers to harvest as much of these animals as necessary, for example lynx in Canada, although on the other hand this may impact the ability of the predator to rebound when the prey population begins to exponentially increase again. Such mathematical models are also crucial in determining the amount of fish which may be sustainably harvested in fisheries, this is known as the maximum sustainable yield.\\n\\nPredator population growth has the effect of controlling the prey population, and can result in the evolution of prey species in favour of genetic characteristics that render it less vulnerable to predation (and the predator may co-evolve, in response).\\n\\nIn the absence of predators, species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation, at least in the short term. An abundant supply of resources can produce a population boom followed by a population crash. Rodents such as lemmings and voles have such population cycles of rapid growth and subsequent decrease. Snowshoe hares populations similarly cycle dramatically, as did those of one of their predators, the lynx. Another example is the cycles among populations of grey wolves and moose in Isle Royale National Park. For some still unexplained reason, such patterns in mammal population dynamics are more prevalent in ecosystems found at more arctic latitudes.\\n\\nSome species such as locusts experience large natural cyclic variations, experienced by farmers as plagues.\\n\\nDetermining population size/density \\nWhen determining whether a population is overpopulated a variety of factors must be looked at. Given complexity of the issue, often it is determined by scientist and wildlife management as to what constitutes such a claim. In many cases scientists will look to food sources and living space to gauge the abundance of a species in a particular area. National parks collect extensive data on the activities and quality of the environment they are established in. This data can be used to track whether a specific species is consuming larger amounts of their desired food source over time.\\n\\nThis is done typically in four ways, the first being “total counting”. Researchers will use aerial photography to count large populations in a specific area such as deer, waterfowl, and other “flocking” or “herd” animals. Incomplete counts involve counting a small subsection of a population and extrapolating the data across the whole area. This method will take into account the behavior of the animals such as how much territory a herd may cover, the density of the population, and other potential factors that may come into question.\\n\\nThe third method is “indirect counts” ; this is done by looking at the environment for signs of animal presence. Typically done by counting fecal matter or dens/nesting of a particular animal. This method is not an accurate method, but gives general counts of a population in a specific locale.\\n\\nLastly the method of mark-recapture is used extensively to determine general population sizes. This method involves the trapping of animals after which some form of tag is placed on the animal and it is released back into the wild. After which, other trappings will determine population size based on the number of marked versus unmarked animals.\\n\\nFish populations \\nsimilar methods can be used to determine the population of fish however some key differences arise in the extrapolation of data. Unlike many land animals  in-land fish populations are divided into smaller population sizes. Factors such as migration may not be relevant when determining population in a specific locales while more important for others such as the many species of salmon or trout. Monitoring of waterways and isolated bodies of water provide more frequently updated information on the populations in specific areas. This is done using similar methods to the mark-recapture methods of many land animals.\\n\\nIntroduced species \\n\\nThe introduction of a foreign species has often caused ecological disturbance, such as when  deer and trout were introduced into Argentina, or when rabbits were introduced to Australia and when predators were introduced in turn to attempt to control the rabbits.\\n\\nWhen an introduced species is so successful that its population begins to increase exponentially and causes deleterious effects to farmers, fisheries or the natural environment, these introduced species are called invasive species.\\n\\nIn the case of the Mute swan, Cygnus olor, their population has rapidly spread across much of North America as well as parts of Canada and western Europe. This species of swan has caused much concern for wildlife management as they damage aquatic vegetation, and harass other waterfowl, dislocating them. The population of the Mute swan has seen an average increase of around 10-18% per year which further threatens to impact the areas they inhabit. Management of the species comes in a variety of ways. Similar to overpopulated or invasive species, hunting is one of the most effective methods of population control. Other methods may involve trapping, relocation, or euthanasia.\\n\\nCriticism\\nIn natural ecosystems, populations naturally expand until they reach the carrying capacity of the environment; if the resources on which they depend are exhausted, they naturally collapse. According to the animal rights movement, calling this an 'overpopulation' is more an ethics question than a scientific fact. Animal rights organisations are commonly critics of ecological systems and wildlife management. Animal rights activists and locals earning income from commercial hunts counter that scientists are outsiders who do not know wildlife issues, and that any slaughter of animals is evil.\\n\\nVarious case studies indicate that use of cattle as 'natural grazers' in many European nature parks due to absence of hunting, culling or natural predators (such as wolves),may cause an overpopulation because the cattle do not migrate. This has the effect of reducing plant biodiversity, as the cattle consume native plants. Because such cattle populations begin to starve and die in the winter as available forage drops, this has caused animal rights activists to advocate supplemental feeding, which has the effect of exacerbating the ecological effects, causing nitrification and eutrophication due to excess faeces, deforestation as trees are destroyed, and biodiversity loss.\\n\\nDespite the ecological effects of overpopulation, wildlife managers may want such high populations in order to satisfy public enjoyment of seeing wild animals. Others contend that introducing large predators such as lynx and wolves may have similar economic benefits, even if tourists rarely actually catch glimpses of such creatures.\\n\\nIn regards to population size, most of the methods used give estimates that vary in accuracy to the actual size and density of the population. Criticisms of theses methods generally fall onto the efficacy of methods used.\\n\\nHuman overpopulation \\n\\nOverpopulation can result from an increase in births, a decline in mortality rates against the background of high fertility rates. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a desert). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like quality of life and risk of starvation and disease as a basis to argue against continuing high human population growth and for population decline.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSee also\\nOvershoot (population)\\n\\nPopulation density\\nPopulation ecology\\nZoology\",\n",
       "       'Sessility is the biological property of an organism describing its lack of a means of self-locomotion. Sessile organisms for which natural motility is absent are normally immobile. This is distinct from the botanical concept of sessility, which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.\\n\\nSessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as corals lay down their own substrate from which they grow. Other sessile organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a man-made object such as a buoy or ship\\'s hull.\\n\\nMobility\\nSessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. Sponges have a motile larval stage and become sessile at maturity. Conversely, many jellyfish develop as sessile polyps early in their life cycle. In the case of the cochineal, it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.\\n\\nReproduction\\nMany sessile animals, including sponges, corals and hydra, are capable of asexual reproduction in situ by the process of budding. Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist Wayne Sousa\\'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, \"suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms\".\\n\\nClumping\\n\\nClumping is a behavior in sessile organisms in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, as can be seen in coral reefs and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.\\n\\nPredominance in coastal environments\\nThe circalittoral zone of coastal environments and biomes are dominated by sessile organisms such as oysters. Carbonate platforms grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually microorganisms, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.\\n\\nBotanical sessility\\nIn anatomy and botany, sessility refers to an organism or biological structure that has no peduncle or stalk. A sessile structure has no stalk.\\n\\nSee: peduncle (anatomy), peduncle (botany) and sessility (botany).\\n\\nSee also\\n Anthozoa\\n Ediacara biota\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAnimal locomotion\\nZoology\\nBiology',\n",
       "       'Allelomimetic behavior or allomimetic behavior is a range of activities in which the performance of a behavior increases the probability of that behavior being performed by other nearby animals. Allelomimetic behavior is sometimes called contagious behavior and has strong components of social facilitation, imitation, and group coordination. It is usually considered to occur between members of the same species. An alternate definition is that allelomimetic behavior is a more intense or more frequent response or the initiation of an already known response, when others around the individual are engaged in the same behavior. It is often referred to as synchronous behavior, mimetic behavior, imitative behavior, and social facilitation.\\n\\nAllelomimetic behavior is displayed in all animals and can occur in any stage of life, but usually starts at a young age. This behavior will continue throughout life, especially when an individual is living in a large group that emphasizes group cohesion. Cohesion is seen as a prerequisite for group living, with synchronous activity being crucial for social cohesion. However, animals in large cohesive groups face trade-offs when allelomimetic behavior is adopted. If the behavior is adopted then the risk of predation or capture decreases significantly but the inter-individual competition for immediate resources, such as food, mates, and space, will increase when cohesion is still stressed. Many collective group decisions in animals are the result of allelomimetism and can be explained by allelomimetic behaviors. Some examples are the cockroaches choosing a single aggregation site, schooling behaviors in fishes, and pheromone-based path selection in ants that allows all the workers to go down the same path to a specific food source. Allelomimetic behavior can also be seen as an animal welfare indicator. For example, if cattle do not have enough room to all lie down simultaneously then it indicates that there are not enough resources present and this can result in lameness of the animals that are forced to stand. Allomimicry is affected by circadian rhythms and circadian cycles of activity within groups which can give the overall appearance of poor animal welfare, if allomimetic behavior were to be used as a welfare indicator then it must be measured several times throughout the course of a day. Most mechanisms involved in performing allelomimetic behavior do not require circadian rhythms to function. Decisions at the individual level are, more often than not, enough to encourage allelomimetism. Patterns of allelomimetic behavior can vary from species to species and can possibly explain other behaviors seen in the animal kingdom.\\n\\nFunction\\nGroup cohesion: Social animals often benefit by behaving in a similar manner to others within their group.  This means that when animals switch behaviors, e.g. from lying to grazing, a degree of synchrony is beneficial.  Sometimes this synchrony can be provided by environmental cues, at other times it is provided by the group members themselves. In 1978, Clayton wrote \"...where environmental stimuli only provide gross synchrony, socially facilitated behavior will provide finer-scale synchrony, and, what is functionally important, greater cohesion of the social group’.\\n\\nThreats \\nSynchronous behavior is also threatened when animals in a mixed-sex herd have differing nutritional or physical necessities. This causes group instability which often splits the herd up into two separate groups; generally all male and all female, to recreate the mimetic behavior in a smaller, same-sex group that has more similar needs to the individual. Synchronized, allelomimetic behavior is also affected by many factors, such as age, general group size, sex, space, resource availability, and domestication. Domestication can also be seen as a threat to allelomimetic behavior. The process of domestication removes many threats like predation, food shortages, and competition from many individuals for breeding by providing basically unlimited food and resources while providing protection from outside predators. Domestication may favour less synchronization for animals and provide an adaptation to mimetic behavior to save energy in domesticated animals. Domestication also changes the inter-individual distances between animals and behavioral synchrony in general, both of which are important for anti-predator strategies and responses.\\n\\nIn horses \\n\\nHorses, like many animals, learn through imitation of their parents, most often the mother or \"broodmare\", or the owner of the foal if the broodmare is not available. If the foal is paired with its mother it will not only mimic the mare\\'s walking style and speed, but it will also mimic the mare\\'s temperament and general behaviors. If a foal was to spend much of its early life around a mare that had an unstable temperament, irrational fears and was difficult to work with then it would grow to be an unstable adult that would develop behavioral abnormalities such as balking. Miller (1996) also adds that behavioral issues can also be removed through allelomimetic processes. Balking is a common behavior in horses and mules that occur from insecurities and fears, and is observed as hesitance with a general fear of moving forward due to the possibility of attack or invasion of their personal space. This behavior can be eliminated if the owner is fearless, looking forward with their head raised high and marching in place. This shows the horse that there is nothing to fear and eventually the horse will mimic the owner\\'s behavior, sync their gate to the owner and follow along. Repeating this behavior as needed will eventually allow the horse to fully incorporate the owner\\'s fearless behavior into its repertoire and prevent balking from reoccurring. Bad habits are also learned through mimicry if the vast majority of the animals present a specific habit.Cribbing is an example of one such habit. If a foal is raised in an environment where this abnormal behavior is performed by the older members of the team, then it will mimic the habit as well, even if the behavior is dangerous to the individual\\'s health. However, the same mimetic behavior that produces these bad habits can help remove them as well. If a broodmare is unable to train her offspring then it falls to the owner to properly train the foal on proper walking gait, speed, and normal behaviors. If the owner spends enough time with their foal keeping a proper stance (ie, an erect, unmoving torso and flexed knees while walking) then the foal will mimic and perform the proper movements for the rest of its life.\\n\\nIn sheep \\n\\nSheep provide a good basis for the evaluation of allelomimetic behavior due to their large group sizes and social behavior. Using them as an experimental subject allows for the determination of the imitative quality and intensity of allelomimetic behavior within a specific herd. Merino sheep, or Ovis aries, are a prey species and a domesticated breed of sheep that require a healthy balance between predator avoidance and foraging space for each individual in the herd. They achieve this balance by spreading out to forage for a period of time then quickly running back to the centre of the herd, creating a fastpacking event. A fastpacking event is specifically when an individual on the outskirts of the herd changes its behavior from grazing to running and moves towards the centre of the herd. Fastpacking events are seen as an adaptive behavior for reducing predation due to the intensity of the response presented in other sheep when one individual is seen running from the outer edges to the centre of the herd. This behavioral change is also referred to as activation/inactivation rates or switching behavior. This change influences other sheep to start running to the centre of the herd until all sheep simultaneously stop in the middle and form a tightly packed herd. The cycle will restart when the herd starts to spread out to forage again. The individual that is displaying the switching behavior from inactivity (grazing in one spot) to activity (running towards the centre of the herd) or vice versa is generally referred to as the herd leader, and other individuals who mimic the switch from inactivity to activity or activity to inactivity are displaying allelomimetic behavior. These activation and inactivation rates are generally more strongly presented in males compared to females and increase as the number of individuals performing an activity increase which is a good indication of imitation present in the herd. For example, if a herd had the majority of individuals active the likelihood of another random individual becoming active increases. The same goes for a herd with a majority of individuals being inactive. In experiments, these events are not specific to a singular spot or caused by any external stimuli that would warrant an alarm response in the sheep. In an experiment performed by Gautrais, members of the same sex more often performed mimetic behavior with each other than when compared to members of a mixed-sex group.  Gautrais also focused on behavioral synchrony of activity and inactivity since cohesion of a group involves individuals being active and inactive at the same time rather than syncing every activity to another individual.\\n\\nEven in the absence of other animals, individuals will switch between behaviors that require activity and inactivity (such as digestion, inactivity is good to promote digestion or hunger outweighing the need for rest). Gautrais believes that this physiological need is what prompted the first individual in his herd experiment to switch from activity to inactivity or vice versa and the other members in the herd to follow suit. However, as the number of individuals in a heard decreases, the option to perform mimetic behavior also decreases. This creates a higher rate of spontaneous switching between activity and inactivity-related behaviors. In contrast, the larger the herd is, the more likely it is for mimetic behaviors to occur with spontaneous switching behavior occurring in the \"herd leader\", with other members following suit in a brief period of time. This is due to the number of con-specifics present at any given time. If the herd is a small group then there are fewer con-specifics which gives less opportunity for imitation to occur in any given individual and a higher rate of switching from inactivity to activity to inactivity will occur. Two ideas are proposed when the original running individual can recruit others into the running group and the herd as a whole can coordinate when to stop running during these fastpacking events. The first idea is that the initiation and inhibition of the packing event is based on allelomimetic effects in local interactions, and the second idea was that a close enough distance between herd neighbours will stop running behavior. These conclusions stem from an idea about optimization processes in sheep that, at an individual level, allows for the balance of exploring as much space as possible to avoid competition for food and keeping in contact with other herd members to avoid predation and reinforce herd cohesion. These optimization processes can adjust the allelomimetic interaction strengths between individuals to ensure both of the above necessities are met.\\n\\nIn cattle \\n\\nThe synchronous behavior that is displayed in cattle is what is typically thought of when discussing allelomimetic behavior.  When the necessary resources for survival, such as food, water, and shelter, are sufficient then cattle will display postural synchrony, lying down or standing while other members of the herd are doing the same. This phenomenon, also referred to as social facilitation, occurs in both free-range cattle that live in pastures, and cattle that live primarily in barns. Social facilitation (or allelomimicry) is the first of two main ideas behind cattle mimicking each other\\'s behavior until the herd acts synchronously, whether it be lying down, standing, or grazing together. According to Stoye and Porter, one member of the herd will alter its behavior (ie. standing to lying down or vice versa) and its nearest neighbor will mimic the behavior, this behavior will travel across the herd until all members are performing one action. Stoye and Porter also noted that it was more likely for a cow to display the same behavior as its nearest neighbor compared to a randomly selected cow from the herd. This behavior continues despite the appearance of free will of an individual to graze/stand or lie down, even when the herd is stationary. The second idea behind synchronized behavior is called concurrent or combined response. This dictates that the collective behavior is a mere coincidence of each individual animal\\'s decision to change their behavior based on external (the discovery of food) or internal (exhaustion, the need for rest/food, or similar daily schedules as other members) factors. A human example of a concurrent behavior is rush hour, many people are driving at the same time due to having a similar schedule to others, not because others are already driving and they decide to as well. Previous studies have identified artificial synchronization of (dairy) cattle behavior because of consistent milking and feeding times. This creates a similar daily schedule for all the cattle to follow, which in turn creates collective behavior between all members during these specific milking and feeding times. According to Stoye and Porter, cattle were most synchronous at night, least synchronous during the afternoon, and intermediately synchronous in the morning. This could be due to all the cattle being milked at similar times in the morning and feeding at similar times during the night, but having no \"scheduled activity\" to perform during the afternoon.\\n\\nIn dogs\\n\\nFeeding habits \\n\\nDogs are one of the most common species to produce allelomimetic behavior and have it go noticed by humans. Studies have been conducted across several breeds of dog regarding eating habits and stress vocalization when alone or with litter-mates. Many results have shown that most dogs will eat more when they are in large groups compared to when they eat alone. This has been coined as the \"social facilitation of eating\" and is not specific to certain breeds. In a study conducted by Compton and Scott, 80% of the dogs studied ate more in groups on the majority of trials and the overall group consumption together was larger than the summation of food consumption between each dog eating individually. When pups were considered food-satiated (would not eat more food even with a dish in front of them), they would resume eating when a hungry litter-mate was introduced into the room with them. It was believed that since everything other than the addition of the hungry litter-mate was held constant, the increased appetite in the food-satiated pup was caused by the presence of the hungry pup and allelomimetic behavior. The allelomimetic behavior that occurs in dogs develops directly from experiences that occur during the critical period of development. Scott\\'s proposed theory of social motivation and the theory of the social facilitation of eating rely heavily on the allelomimetic behavioral system that occurs in these animals.\\n\\nIsolation and vocalization responses \\nIsolation is a large stressor for many dogs and can result in separation anxiety if they are left alone from others for extended lengths of time during a critical period in their development. If a puppy is separated from their litter-mates, home pen, or owners during a critical period it will produce an intense negative emotional reaction and the reaction will subside when they return to their litter-mates, home pen, or owners. This reaction is a natural conditioned learning paradigm that will have to be constantly repeated during their infancy to remove the intensity of the response. When housed with other litter-mates the individual will be strongly motivated to mimic the behavior of the animals around it. Introducing other litter-mates who do not experience a severe negative emotion to isolation is one of the ways to avoid negative reactions to isolation in the individual in question. This provides a base for mimetic behavior to occur and the pup experiencing severe negative emotions will begin to mimic the behavior of the litter-mates and adopt their neutral behavior. Scott and Bronson replicated a study originally conducted by Fredericson in 1952 about vocalization rates of beagle puppies when confined in a box alone or with a companion. Fredericson found that 75% of puppies would vocalize significantly less when confined with another puppy compared to alone, a result that was replicated and confirmed by Scott and Bronson in 1971. Many dogs were more distressed when they were placed alone in an unfamiliar environment compared to a known environment, or an unfamiliar environment with litter-mates. This increase in calm behavior when multiple litter-mates are in an unfamiliar environment is caused by allelomimetic behavior. If one pup is calm, many dogs will mimic that behavior, creating a litter of relaxed dogs. Likewise, if there is one distressed pup, many dogs could also mimic the distressed behavior but the former is more common among experiments.\\n\\nIn chickens and roosters \\n\\nAllelomimetic behavior can often be affected by domestication and lead to the evolution of new social behaviors, or subtle changes in current social behaviors.  It is thought that domestication would reduce the level of allelomimetic behavior in animals due to the removal of many important factors that create mimicries such as predation, food pressures and competition between species members. Since there is no need to worry about possible predation or a lack of resources in a domesticated environment, the allelomimetic behaviors seen in non-domesticated species evolved out and the adaptation to domestication became the new normal. Mimetic behaviors that once incorporated anti-predator strategies or mating strategies became unnecessary and the use of these behaviors decreased. An experiment was conducted by Eklund and Jensen using an ancestor of all domesticated chickens, the red junglefowl, and a domesticated breed, the white leghorn.  They showed that allelomimetic behavior was more prominent and used more frequently in the non-domesticated red junglefowl compared to the white leghorn, most likely due to the chance of predation, starvation, and the lack of shelter playing a role in producing these allelomimetic behaviors. Total synchronization only occurred in both species during comforting behaviors such as perching and dust bathing. In activities outside of comfort behavior, there was little mimetic behavior in the domesticated white leghorn and inter-individual distances presented by the chickens during perching was larger than the non-domesticated species. Perching in the red junglefowl occurred more frequently and was more mimetic than in the white leghorn. The social behavior of the red junglefowl was also affected by allelomimetism, where behaviors such as feather pecking were more synchronized than in the white leghorn. A difference in feeding synchrony also appeared in females versus males. Females were more likely to mimic other females\\' eating behaviors compared to a mixed-sex group or males mimicking males.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nEthology',\n",
       "       'Broodiness is the action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs to incubate them, often requiring the non-expression of many other behaviors including feeding and drinking. Being broody has been defined as \"Being in a state of readiness to brood eggs that is characterized by cessation of laying and by marked changes in behavior and physiology\". .  Broodiness is usually associated with female birds, although males of some bird species become broody and some non-avian animals also show broodiness.\\n\\nIn wild birds\\nIn wild birds, egg incubation is a normal and essential phase in the process of reproduction, and in many families of birds, e.g. pigeons, the eggs are incubated by both male and female parents.\\n\\nBroodiness in males\\nIn all species of phalaropes, the males become broody rather than the female. The females leave the nest after finishing laying to let the males incubate the eggs and take care of the young. Male emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) become broody after their mates start laying, and begin to incubate the eggs before the laying period is complete.\\n\\nNon-broodiness\\nA small number of atypical birds such as Passeriformes of the genus Molothrus (cowbirds) do not become broody but lay their eggs in the nests of other species for incubation, known as brood parasitism. The Australian brushturkey (Alectura lathami) also does not become broody, rather, it covers the eggs with a large mound of vegetable matter, which decomposes, keeping the eggs warm until hatching.  The crab-plover, (Dromas ardeola), which lives on the coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean, lets its eggs incubate primarily by the heat of the sun, and will leave its nest unattended, occasionally for days at a time.\\n\\nIn domestic poultry\\n\\nBroody hens can be recognized by their behaviour.  They sit firmly over the eggs, and when people approach or try to remove the eggs, threaten the person by erecting their feathers, emitting a characteristic sound like clo-clo-clo and will peck aggressively. When broody, hens often temporarily cease eating or reduce their feed consumption.\\n\\nLetting eggs accumulate in a relatively dark place near the floor often stimulates hens to become broody. Placing artificial eggs into nests also stimulates broodiness. Keeping hens in dark places with warm temperatures and in view of vocalising orphan chicks can induce broodiness, even in breeds that normally do not go broody.\\n\\nSome environmental conditions stimulate broodiness. In heavy breeds of chickens, warm weather tends to bring about broodiness. Removing eggs each day, out of the sight of the hens, helps avoid broodiness not only in domestic poultry but also in some wild species in captivity. This continued egg laying means more eggs are laid than would occur under natural conditions. Poultry farming in battery cages also helps to avoid broodiness.\\n\\nIn commercial egg-laying\\n\\nBecause hens stop laying when they become broody, commercial poultry breeders perceive broodiness not as a normal physiological process, but as an impediment to egg and poultry meat production.  With domestication, it has become more profitable to incubate eggs artificially, while keeping hens in full egg production. To help achieve this, there has been intense artificial selection for non-broodiness in commercial egg laying chickens and parent stock of poultry.  As a result of this artificial selection, broodiness has been reduced to very low levels in present-day breeds of commercial fowl, both among egg-laying and meat-producing breeds.\\n\\nPhysiological basis\\n\\nBroodiness is due to the secretion of the hormone prolactin by the anterior lobe of the hypophysis. Prolactin injection in hens provokes egg laying to stop within a few days, vitellum reabsorption, ovary regression (hens only have a left ovary) and finally broodiness. However, attempts to stop broodiness by the administration of several hormones have failed because this state, once evoked, requires time to revert.\\n\\nProlactin injections inhibit the production of gonadotropin hormone, a hormone that stimulates ovarian follicles which is produced in the frontal lobe of hypophysis.\\n\\nCastrated males can go broody with baby chicks, showing that broodiness is not limited to females, however, castrated males do not incubate eggs.\\n\\nContrary to common opinion, the temperature of broody hens barely differs from that of laying hens. Broody hens pluck feathers from their chest, using them to cover the eggs.  As a consequence of this, they develop one or several patches of bare skin on the ventral surface.  These reddish, well-vascularized areas of skin are usually called brood patches. which improve heat transfer to the eggs.\\n\\nGenetic basis\\n\\nBroodiness is more common in some chicken breeds than others, indicating that it is a heritable characteristic. Breeds such as Cochin, Cornish and Silkie exhibit a tendency to broodiness, including brooding eggs from other species such as quails, pheasants, turkeys and geese. In some breeds such as the White Leghorn, broodiness is extremely rare.\\n\\nSome studies on crosses of chicken breeds point to the hypothesis of complementary genes acting on broodiness. Other results point to the hypothesis of sex-linked genes, or, inheritance through the maternal chromosome. Although these studies have been made on different breeds of chickens, their results are not contradictory. There is common agreement that artificial selection for egg production succeeded in reducing the incidence of broody hens in chicken populations.\\n\\nChicken breeds that commonly exhibit broodiness\\n\\nChicken breeds that rarely exhibit broodiness\\n\\nBroodiness in non-avian animals\\n\\nThere is some evidence that non-avian dinosaurs also practiced brooding. A specimen of the extinct Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm.\\n\\nSeveral deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner.\\n\\nLungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae lay a small number of eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. The female salamander often broods the eggs and in the genus Ensatinas, she has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.  The black mountain salamander mother broods her eggs, guarding them from predation as the larvae feed on the yolks of their eggs. They eventually break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse. Some species of Gymnophiona (caecilians, with long, cylindrical, limbless bodies) brood their eggs.\\n\\nMost pythons coil around their egg-clutches and remain with them until they hatch. A female python will not leave the eggs, except to occasionally bask in the sun or drink water. She will even “shiver” to generate heat to incubate the eggs.\\n\\nSome cichlid fish lay their eggs in the open, on rocks, leaves, or logs.  Male and female parents usually engage in differing brooding roles. Most commonly, the male patrols the pair\\'s territory and repels intruders, while females fan water over the eggs, removing the infertile and leading the fry while foraging. However, both sexes are able to perform the full range of parenting behaviours.\\n\\nMouthbrooding\\nMouthbrooding, also known as oral incubation, refers to the care given by some groups of animals to fertilized eggs or their offspring by holding them in the mouth of the parent for extended periods of time. Although it has been observed in a variety of animals, most mouthbrooders are fish. The parent performing this behavior invariably feeds less often and afterwards will be underweight, requiring a period of feeding and restoring the depleted energy reserves.\\n\\nOthers\\nMarsupial frogs are so-called because they possess a dorsal brood pouch. In some species the eggs are fertilized on the female\\'s lower back, and are inserted in her pouch with the aid of the male\\'s toes. The eggs remain in contact with the female\\'s vascular tissue, which provides them oxygen.\\n\\nSome animals have a common name that includes the word \\'brood\\' or its derivatives, although it is arguable whether the animals show \\'broodiness\\' per se.  For example, the female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid and the tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks the mother opens her mouth wide and regurgitates the tadpoles which hop away from her mouth.  The brooding sea anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is a colonial hermaphrodite that fertilizes and incubates its eggs internally. The motile larvae, after swimming out of the mouth, migrate down to the disk and become fixed there until they become little anemones, ready to move and feed independently.\\n\\nIn Darwin\\'s frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), the female lays about 30 eggs and then the male guards them for about two weeks, until they hatch. The male then takes all the survivors and carries around the developing young in his vocal pouch. When the tiny tadpoles have developed they hop out and swim away.  In this animal, the parents hold the hatched young rather than eggs in their mouths, so is arguably not showing \\'broodiness\\'.\\n\\nSee also\\nBrood parasite\\nBrood patch\\nChicken\\nEgg incubation\\nNesting instinct\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAviculture\\nPoultry\\nEthology\\nOology',\n",
       "       'Pursuit predation is a form of predation in which predators actively give chase to their prey, either solitarily or as a group.  It is an alternate predation strategy to ambush predation — pursuit predators rely on superior speed, endurance and/or teamwork to seize the prey, while ambush predators use stealth, luring, the use of surroundings and the element of surprise to capture the prey.  While the two patterns of predation are not mutually exclusive, morphological differences in an organism\\'s body plan can create an evolutionary bias favoring either type of predation.\\n\\nPursuit predation is typically observed in carnivorous species within the kingdom Animalia, such as cheetahs, lions, wolves and early homo species.  The chase can be initiated either by the predator, or by the prey if it is alerted to a predator\\'s presence and attempt to flee before the predator gets close.  The chase ends either when the predator successfully catches up and tackles the prey, or when the predator abandons the attempt after the prey outruns it and escapes.\\n\\nOne particular form of pursuit predation is persistence hunting, where the predator follows the prey slowly but persistently to wear it down physically with fatigue or overheating; some animals are examples of both types of pursuit.\\n\\nStrategy \\nThere is still uncertainty as to whether predators behave with a general tactic or strategy while preying. However, among pursuit predators there are several common behaviors. Often, predators will scout potential prey, assessing prey quantity and density prior to engaging in a pursuit. Certain predators choose to pursue prey primarily in a group of conspecifics; these animals are known as pack hunters or group pursuers. Other species choose to hunt alone. These two behaviors are typically due to differences in hunting success, where some groups are very successful in groups and others are more successful alone. Pursuit predators may also choose to either exhaust their metabolic resources rapidly or pace themselves during a chase. This choice can be influenced by prey species, seasonal settings, or temporal settings. Predators that rapidly exhaust their metabolic resources during a chase tend to first stalk their prey, slowly approaching their prey to decrease chase distance and time. When the predator is at a closer distance (one that would lead to easier prey capture), it finally gives chase. Pacing pursuit is more commonly seen in group pursuit, as individual animals do not need to exert as much energy to capture prey. However, this type of pursuit requires group coordination, which may have varying degrees of success. Since groups can engage in longer chases, they often focus on separating a weaker or slower prey item during pursuit. Morphologically speaking, while ambush predation requires stealth, pursuit predation requires speed; pursuit predators are proportionally long-limbed and equipped with cursorial adaptations. Current theories suggest that this proportionally long-limbed approach to body plan was an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation.\\n\\nGroup pursuers\\n\\nVertebrates\\n\\nGroup pursuers hunt with a collection of conspecifics. Group pursuit is usually seen in species of relatively high sociality; in vertebrates, individuals often seem to have defined roles in pursuit.\\n\\nMammals \\nAfrican wild dog (Lycaon pictus) packs have been known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey\\'s escape path. The group of chase initiators coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey\\'s escape path will be effectively cut off. \\n\\nBottlenose dolphins (Tursiops) have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins leap out and catch the fish. \\n\\nIn lion (Panthera leo) pack hunting, each member of the hunting group is assigned a position, from left wing to right wing, in order to better obtain prey. Such specializations in roles within the group are thought to increase sophistication in technique; lion wing members are faster, and will drive prey toward the center where the larger, stronger, killing members of the pride will take down the prey. Many observations of group pursuers note an optimal hunting size in which certain currencies (mass of prey killed or number of prey killed) are maximized with respect to costs (kilometers covered or injuries sustained). Groups size is often dependent on aspects of the environment: number of prey, prey density, number of competitors, seasonal changes, etc.\\n\\nBirds \\nWhile birds are generally believed to be individual hunters, there are a few examples of birds that cooperate during pursuits. Harris\\'s hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) have two cooperative strategies for hunting: Surrounding and cover penetration, and long chase relay attack.\\n\\nThe first strategy involves a group of hawks surrounding prey hidden under some form of cover, while another hawk attempts to penetrate the prey\\'s cover. The penetration attempt flushes the prey out from its cover where it is swiftly killed by one of the surrounding hawks.\\n\\nThe second strategy is less commonly used: It involves a \"relay attack\" in which a group of hawks, led by a \"lead\" hawk, engage in a long chase for prey. The \"lead\" hawk will dive in order to kill the prey. If the dive is unsuccessful, the role of the \"lead\" shifts to another hawk who will then dive in another attempt to kill the prey. During one observed relay attack, 20 dives and hence 20\\xa0lead switches were exhibited.\\n\\nInvertebrates\\n\\nAs in vertebrates, there are many species of invertebrates which actively pursue prey in groups and exhibit task specialization, but while the vertebrates change their behavior based on their role in hunting, invertebrate task delegation is usually based on actual morphological differences. The vast majority of eusocial insects have castes within a population which tend to differ in size and have specialized structures for different tasks. This differentiation is taken to the extreme in the groups isoptera and hymenoptera, or termites and ants, bees, and wasps respectively.\\n\\nTermite-hunting ants of the genus Pachycondyla, also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants. Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust exoskeletons, and so they make up the front lines of raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have a steady stream of prey.\\n\\nAsian giant hornets, Vespa mandarinia, form similar raiding parties to hunt their prey, which usually consists of honeybees. The giant hornets group together and as a team can decimate an entire honeybee colony, especially those of non-native European honeybees. Alone, the hornets are subject to attack by the smaller bees, who swarm the hornet and vibrate their abdomens to generate heat, collectively cooking the hornet until it dies. By hunting in groups, the hornets avoid this problem.\\n\\nIndividual pursuers\\n\\nVertebrates\\n\\nMammals \\n\\nWhile most big cat species are either solitary ambush predators or pack hunters, cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are primarily solitary pursuit predators.  Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal with running speeds reaching , cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both rely on anaerobic metabolism and can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for up to a distance of approximately , which is only about 20 seconds of sprinting, before fatigue and overheating set in.  Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed quietly walking towards the prey to shorten the distance before running at moderate speeds during chases.\\n\\nThere are claims that the key to cheetahs\\' pursuit being successful may not be just burst of sheer speed.  Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to change directions in very short amounts of time while running at very high speeds.  This maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high-speed pursuits, as it allows a cheetah to quickly close the distance without having to decelerate when the prey suddenly changes direction.  Due to being lightly built, cheetahs will try to foot sweep and unbalance the prey, instead of grasping and tackling.  Only after the prey has fallen over and thus momentarily stopped running, the cheetah will pounce and try to subdue it with a throat bite.\\n\\nBirds \\nThe Painted redstart (Myioborus pictus) is one of the most well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies\\' escape path intersects with the redstart\\'s central field of vision. When prey\\'s path are in this field of vision, the redstart\\'s prey capture rate is at its maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey\\'s visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment. The effectiveness of this pursuit can also be explained by \"rare enemy effect\", an evolutionary consequence of multi-species predator-prey interactions.\\n\\nInvertebrates\\n\\nDragonflies are skilled aerial pursuers; they have a 97% success rate for prey capture. This success rate is a consequence of the \"decision\" on which prey to pursue, based on initial conditions. Observations of several species of perching dragonflies show more pursuit initiations at larger starting distances for larger size prey species than for much smaller prey. Further evidence points to a potential bias towards larger prey, due to more substantial metabolic rewards. This bias is in spite of the fact that larger prey are typically faster and choosing them results in less successful pursuits. Dragonflies high success rate for prey capture may also be due to their interception foraging method. Unlike classical pursuit, in which the predator aims for the current position of their prey, dragonflies predict the prey\\'s direction of motion, as in parallel navigation. Perching dragonflies (Libellulidae family), have been observed \"staking out\" high density prey spots prior to pursuit. There are no noticeable distinctions in prey capture efficiency between males and females. Further, percher dragonflies are bound by their visual range. They are more likely to engage in pursuit when prey come within a subtended angle of around 1-2 degrees. Angles greater than this are outside of a dragonflies visual range.\\n\\nEvolutionary basis of the behavior\\n\\nEvolution as a countermeasure \\nCurrent theory on the evolution of pursuit predation suggests that the behavior is an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation. Prey animals vary in their likelihood to avoid predation, and it is predation failure that drives evolution of both prey and predator. Predation failure rates vary wildly across the animal kingdom; raptorial birds can fail anywhere from 20% to 80% of the time in predation, while predatory mammals usually fail more than half the time. Prey adaptation drives these low rates in three phases: the detection phase, the pursuit phase, and the resistance phase. The pursuit phase drove the evolution of distinct behaviors for pursuit predation. \\nAs selective pressure on prey is higher than on predators  adaptation usually occurs in prey long before the reciprocal adaptations in predators. Evidence in the fossil record supports this, with no evidence of modern pursuit predators until the late Tertiary period. Certain adaptations, like long limbs in ungulates, that were thought to be adaptive for speed against predatory behavior have been found to predate predatory animals by over 20\\xa0million years. Because of this, modern pursuit predation is an adaptation that may have evolved separately and much later as a need for more energy in colder and more arid climates. Longer limbs in predators, the key morphological adaptation required for lengthy pursuit of prey, is tied in the fossil record to the late Tertiary. It is now believed that modern pursuit predators like the wolf and lion evolved this behavior around this time period as a response to ungulates increasing feeding range. As ungulate prey moved into a wider feeding range to discover food in response to changing climate, predators evolved the longer limbs and behavior necessary to pursue prey across larger ranges. In this respect, pursuit predation is not co-evolutionary with prey adaptation, but a direct response to prey. Prey\\'s adaptation to climate is the key formative reason for evolving the behavior and morphological necessities of pursuit predation.\\n\\nIn addition to serving as a countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging. For example, polar bears typically act as specialized predators of seal pups and operate in a manner closely predicted by the optimal foraging theory. However, they have been seen to occasionally employ more energy-inefficient pursuit predation tactics on flightless geese. This alternative predatory strategy may serve as a back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may even be a function of filling dietary needs.\\n\\nEvolution from an ecological basis \\nPursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation\\'s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.\\n\\nAnti-predator adaptation to pursuit predation\\n\\nAnti-predator adaptation\\n\\nJust as the evolutionary arms race has led to the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. Alarm displays such as eastern swamphen\\'s tail flicking, white-tailed deer\\'s tail flagging, and  Thomson\\'s gazelles\\' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit. These tactic are believed to signal that a predator\\'s presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. Alarm displays are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson\\'s gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present. In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.\\n\\nThe confusion effect \\n\\nIn many species that fall prey to pursuit predation, gregariousness on a massive scale has evolved as a protective behavior. Such herds can be conspecific (all individuals are of one species) or heterospecific. This is primarily due to the confusion effect, which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals. This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size.  This is especially true in open habitats, such as grasslands or open ocean ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or reef. Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being starlings and sardines. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically.  In one study, wildebeest on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population; researchers found that the wildebeest with white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates.  By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no sexual dimorphism, and why many species in heterospecific schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nEcology\\nBiology\\nBehavior',\n",
       "       \"A circannual cycle is a biological process that occurs in living creatures over the period of approximately one year. This cycle was first discovered by Ebo Gwinner and Canadian biologist Ted Pengelley. It is classified as an Infradian rhythm, which is biological process with a period longer than that of a circadian rhythm, less than one cycle per 24 hours. These processes continue even in artificial environments in which seasonal cues have been removed by scientists. The term circannual is Latin, circa meaning approximately and annual relating to one year. Chronobiology is the field of biology pertaining to periodic rhythms that occur in living organisms in response to external stimuli such as photoperiod.\\n\\nCycles come from genetic evolution in animals which allows them to create regulatory cycles to improve their fitness. Evolution for these traits comes from the increased reproductive success of animals most capable of predicting the regular changes in the environment like seasonal changes and adapt capitalize on the times when success was greatest. The idea of evolved biological clocks exists not only for animals but also in plant species which exhibit cyclic behaviors without environmental cues.  Plentiful research has been done on the biological clocks and what behaviors they are responsible for in animals, circannual rhythms are just one example of a biological clock.\\n\\nRhythms are driven by hormone cycles and seasonal rhythms can endure for long periods of time in animals even without photoperiod signaling which comes with seasonal changes. They are a driver of annual behaviors such as hibernation, mating and the gain or loss of weight for seasonal changes. Circannual cycles can be defined by three main aspects being that they must persist without apparent time cues, be able to be phase shifted, and should not be changed by temperature. Circannual cycles have important impacts on when animal behaviors are performed and the success of those behaviors. Circannual cycles can be defined by three main aspects being that they must persist without apparent time cues, be able to be phase shifted, and should not be changed by temperature.\\n\\nThe location of the physical circannual timer in organisms and how it works are almost entirely unknown.\\n\\nExamples \\nIn one study performed by Eberhard Gwinner, two species of birds were born in a controlled environment without ever being exposed to external stimuli. They were presented with a fixed Photoperiod of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness each day. The birds were exposed to these conditions for eight years and consistently molted at the same time as they would have in the wild, indicating that this physiological cycle is innate rather than governed environmentally.\\n\\nResearchers Ted Pengelley and Ken Fisher studied the circannual clock in the golden-mantled ground squirrel. They exposed the squirrels to twelve hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and at a constant temperature for three years. Despite this constant cycle, they continued to hibernate once a year with each episode preceded by an increase in body weight and food consumption. During the first year, the squirrels began hibernation in late October. They started hibernating in mid August and early April respectively for the following two years, displaying a circannual rhythm with a period of about 10 months.\\n\\nAn annual rhythm has been observed in humans diagnosed with obsessive compulsive tic disorder (OCTD). The study focused on observing the patients’ seasonal patterns and how the cycle of seasons affected their behaviors. They observed that there was a statistically significant annual rhythm in patients with OC symptoms but not in patients with tic symptoms. As a result of the study, the researchers concluded that treatments for this disorder can be implemented following an observation of the patient’s cycle and annual rhythm that they follow.\\n\\nGwinner observed the willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) which is a bird species that migrates seasonally to tropical and southern Africa. They follow an annual cycle of migration starting in September and ending in mid-November for the winter and then migrate back between March and May. The willow warblers follow this cycle to maximize reproduction in the spring/summer as well as increasing available resources in the fall/winter. Gwinner observed that even through a lack of environmental cues for migration, the willow warblers followed precise schedules attributed to their circannual rhythm. The willow warblers would consistently molt between January and February, they would have gonadal growth initiate in the winter and continue on their migration back for the spring, and they would begin a fattening process precisely at the same time year after year for their spring migrations.\\n\\nA classic example in insects is the varied carpet beetle.In a study performed by T. Nisimura and H. Numata in 2003, the seasonal timing and synchrony of pupation in the Varied Carpet Beetle (Anthrenus verbasci) was determined by studying how natural patterns in photoperiod and temperature affected it. The authors first fostered larvae under various constant photoperiods at a constant temperature of 20℃ to determine if there was a critical duration of the photophase that affected the phase of circannual rhythm. Secondly, they examined if a decrease in temperature caused a phase-shift in the circannual rhythm. Third, they fostered larvae under a natural photoperiod at a constant temperature of 20℃ and compared it to a group under natural photoperiod and temperature. Lastly, to clarify the significance of the circannual control of the A. verbasci life cycle, larvae were reared under natural photoperiod and temperature from the various times of the year. The results showed that the critical day-length was between 13 and 14 hours of light, that a decrease in temperature of 5℃ did not affect the phase-shift, that larvae under controlled light but fluctuating temperatures experienced a delay in pupation compared to natural light and natural temperatures and that spring in Japan was the best time of the year for synchronous pupation which slowed as spring turned to summer.\\n\\nCircannual and circadian rhythms can be influenced by metabolism which is primarily influenced from natural external environmental factors such as daily weather and seasons. Location adaptations are needed to survive in extreme environmental changes. These rhythms are influenced by variable environmental cues, and in some species are influenced by internal cues. In a study conducted by Catalina Reyes, the authors took a further look into how red-eared sliders showed circadian and circannual rhythms in metabolism, and if metabolic rates overall influenced the circadian and circannual cues. These rhythms were studied over one year, and displayed evidence of endogenous circadian and circannual rhythms in metabolism. The understanding was that in order for these rhythms to be expressed, environmental cues influenced these thermo and phyto cycles eliciting circadian and circannual rhythms of the red-eared sliders. The sensitivity to these environmental influences reflect adaptations to migration patterns that could serve as further insight to the cost-and-benefit of transportation and risk of predation.\\n\\nEnvironmental external factors are the key drivers into influencing circannual and circadian rhythms. Although they may all differ depending on species, they all are influenced by factors like weather and seasonality. At temperate latitudes, circannual rhythms align with the day lengths, and in mammals, the hormone melatonin is reactive to the proportional length of evenings. Authors that collaborated on this study focused on the circannual alignment of, (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), better known as arctic reindeer. They are known to limit production of a rhythmic melatonin signal when exposed to prolonged periods of midwinter darkness and midsummer light. Areas in temperate regions are known to have prolonged periods of light and darkness, for instance, like in Alaska. They concluded that rhythmical melatonin secretion is a psychological response to the orientation of the sun in early winter months and the delay of circuannual programme during the following autumnal months.\\n\\nBiological advantages \\nGenerating biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes in the environment before they occur, thus providing the organisms with time to prepare and survive. For example, some plants have a very strict time frame in regards to blooming and preparing for spring. If they begin their preparations too early or too late they risk not being pollinated, competing with different species, or other factors that might affect their survival rate. Having a circannual cycle may keep them from making this mistake if a particular geographic region experiences a false spring, where the weather becomes exceptionally warm early for a short period of time before returning to winter temperatures.\\n\\nSimilarly, bird plumage and mammal fur change with the approach of winter, and is triggered by the shortening photoperiod of autumn. The circannual cycle can also be useful for animals that Migrate or Hibernate. Many animals' reproductive organs change in response to changes in photoperiod. Male gonads will grow during the onset of spring to promote reproduction among the species. These enlarged gonads would be nearly impossible to keep year round and would be inefficient for the species. Many female animals will only produce eggs during certain times of the year.\\n\\nInteraction with changing climate \\nChanging climate may unravel ecosystems in which different organisms use different internal calendars. Warming temperatures may lead to earlier blooms of flora in spring. For instance, one study performed by Menzel et al., analyzed 125,000 phenological records of 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 and found that 78% of all plants studied advanced in flowering, leafing, and fruiting while only three percent were significantly delayed. They determined that the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade in Europe. Meanwhile, fauna may breed or migrate based on the length of day, and thus might arrive too late for critical food supplies they co-evolved with.\\n\\nFor example, the Parus major closely times the hatching of their chicks to the emergence of the protein-rich winter moth caterpillar, which in turn hatches to meet the budding of oaks. These birds are a single-brood bird, meaning they breed once a year with about nine chicks per brood. If the birds and caterpillars and buds all emerge at the right time, the caterpillars eat the new oak leaves and their population increases dramatically, and this hopefully will coincide with the arrival of the new chicks, allowing them to eat. But if plants, insects, and birds respond differently to the advance of spring or other phenology changes, the relationship may be altered.\\n\\nAs another example, studies of the Pied Flycatcher (ficedula hypoleuca) have shown that their spring migration timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length. These particular birds overwinter in dry tropical forest in Western Africa and breed in temperate forests in Europe, over 4,500\\xa0km away. From 1980-2000, temperatures at the time of arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly. They have advanced their mean laying date by ten days, but have not advanced the spring arrival on their breeding grounds because their migration behavior is triggered by photoperiod rather than temperature.\\n\\nIn short, even if each individual species can easily live with elevated temperatures, disruptions of phenology timing at ecosystem level may still imperil them.\\n\\nChallenges for scientific study \\nOne reason for the paucity of research on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle to the length of the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology difficult. It takes an entire year to get a time series which makes it difficult to see how these cycles adjust over the years. To put this into perspective, a two-week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.\\n\\nRelated Topics  \\nCircadian Rhythm - If circadian rhythm enables animals to prepare physiologically and behaviorally for certain predictable daily changes in the environment, might not some animals possess a circannual rhythm that runs on an approximately 365 cycle? A circannual clock mechanism could be similar to the circadian master clock, with an environment-independent timer capable of generating a circannual rhythm in conjunction with a mechanism that keeps the clock entertained to local conditions. \\n\\nNocturnality  is when animals are active during the night, and inactive during the day. This adaptation allows for animals to avoid predators that may not have this adaptability, as well as having availability to resources that are otherwise not harvested by non-nocturnal animals. Some animals that are nocturnal have disadvantages in animal sensory systems, such as bats, they have poor vision and use other adaptations such as echolocation, something a non-nocturnal animal would not have. \\n\\nPhotoperiodism is the ability of plants and animals to use the length of day or night, resulting in the modification of their activities. A response from an organism to the length in daylight and time that allows for adaptations to seasonal variations and environmental changes. It orchestrates seasonal growth, development, reproduction, migration, and dormancy that affect survivorship and reproductive success. Changes in photoperiod over days and seasons created the opportunity for the development of internal clocks and eventually create circadian and circannual rhythms.  Photoperiod can affect the circannual rhythms of animals if changed significantly.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nBiological concepts\",\n",
       "       'Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.\\n\\nRunning in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.\\n\\nIt is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world\\'s most accessible sport.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nIt is thought that human running evolved at least four and a half million years ago out of the ability of the ape-like Australopithecus, an early ancestor of humans, to walk upright on two legs.\\n\\nEarly humans most likely developed into endurance runners from the practice of persistence hunting of animals, the activity of following and chasing until a prey is too exhausted to flee, succumbing to \"chase myopathy\" (Sears 2001), and that human features such as the nuchal ligament, abundant sweat glands, the Achilles tendons, big knee joints and muscular glutei maximi, were changes caused by this type of activity (Bramble & Lieberman 2004, et al.). The theory as first proposed used comparative physiological evidence and the natural habits of animals when running, indicating the likelihood of this activity as a successful hunting method. Further evidence from observation of modern-day hunting practice also indicated this likelihood (Carrier et al. 1984).\\n According to Sears (p.\\xa012) scientific investigation (Walker & Leakey 1993) of the Nariokotome Skeleton provided further evidence for the Carrier theory.\\n\\nCompetitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas such as Greece, Egypt, Asia, and the East African Rift in Africa. The Tailteann Games, an Irish sporting festival in honor of the goddess Tailtiu, dates back to 1829 BCE, and is one of the earliest records of competitive running. The origins of the Olympics and Marathon running are shrouded by myth and legend, though the first recorded games took place in 776 BCE. Running in Ancient Greece can be traced back to these games of 776 BCE.\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nRunning gait can be divided into two phases in regard to the lower extremity: stance and swing. These can be further divided into absorption, propulsion, initial swing and terminal swing.  Due to the continuous nature of running gait, no certain point is assumed to be the beginning.  However, for simplicity, it will be assumed that absorption and footstrike mark the beginning of the running cycle in a body already in motion.\\n\\nFootstrike\\nFootstrike occurs when a plantar portion of the foot makes initial contact with the ground.  Common footstrike types include forefoot, midfoot and heel strike types. These are characterized by initial contact of the ball of the foot, ball and heel of the foot simultaneously and heel of the foot respectively.  During this time the hip joint is undergoing extension from being in maximal flexion from the previous swing phase.  For proper force absorption, the knee joint should be flexed upon footstrike and the ankle should be slightly in front of the body. Footstrike begins the absorption phase as forces from initial contact are attenuated throughout the lower extremity. Absorption of forces continues as the body moves from footstrike to midstance due to vertical propulsion from the toe-off during a previous gait cycle.\\n\\nMidstance\\nMidstance is defined as the time at which the lower extremity limb of focus is in knee flexion directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hips.  It is at this point that propulsion begins to occur as the hips undergo hip extension, the knee joint undergoes extension and the ankle undergoes plantar flexion.  Propulsion continues until the leg is extended behind the body and toe off occurs.  This involves maximal hip extension, knee extension and plantar flexion for the subject, resulting in the body being pushed forward from this motion and the ankle/foot leaves the ground as initial swing begins.\\n\\nPropulsion phase\\nMost recent research, particularly regarding the footstrike debate, has focused solely on the absorption phases for injury identification and prevention purposes.  The propulsion phase of running involves the movement beginning at midstance until toe off. From a full stride length model however, components of the terminal swing and footstrike can aid in propulsion.\\nSet up for propulsion begins at the end of terminal swing as the hip joint flexes, creating the maximal range of motion for the hip extensors to accelerate through and produce force.  As the hip extensors change from reciporatory inhibitors to primary muscle movers, the lower extremity is brought back toward the ground, although aided greatly by the stretch reflex and gravity. Footstrike and absorption phases occur next with two types of outcomes.  This phase can be only a continuation of momentum from the stretch reflex reaction to hip flexion, gravity and light hip extension with a heel strike, which does little to provide force absorption through the ankle joint. With a mid/forefoot strike, loading of the gastro-soleus complex from shock absorption will serve to aid in plantar flexion from midstance to toe-off.\\nAs the lower extremity enters midstance, true propulsion begins. The hip extensors continue contracting along with help from the acceleration of gravity and the stretch reflex left over from maximal hip flexion during the terminal swing phase.  Hip extension pulls the ground underneath the body, thereby pulling the runner forward.  During midstance, the knee should be in some degree of knee flexion due to elastic loading from the absorption and footstrike phases to preserve forward momentum. The ankle joint is in dorsiflexion at this point underneath the body, either elastically loaded from a mid/forefoot strike or preparing for stand-alone concentric plantar flexion.\\nAll three joints perform the final propulsive movements during toe-off. The plantar flexors plantar flex, pushing off from the ground and returning from dorsiflexion in midstance.  This can either occur by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or concentrically contracting from a heel strike.  With a forefoot strike, both the ankle and knee joints will release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase. The quadriceps group/knee extensors go into full knee extension, pushing the body off of the ground.  At the same time, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, adding to a pulling motion on the ground and beginning the initial swing phase.  The hip extensors extend to maximum, adding the forces pulling and pushing off of the ground.  The movement and momentum generated by the hip extensors also contributes to knee flexion and the beginning of the initial swing phase.\\n\\nSwing phase\\n\\nInitial swing is the response of both stretch reflexes and concentric movements to the propulsion movements of the body.  Hip flexion and knee flexion occur beginning the return of the limb to the starting position and setting up for another footstrike.  Initial swing ends at midswing, when the limb is again directly underneath the trunk, pelvis and hip with the knee joint flexed and hip flexion continuing.  Terminal swing then begins as hip flexion continues to the point of activation of the stretch reflex of the hip extensors.  The knee begins to extend slightly as it swings to the anterior portion of the body.  The foot then makes contact with the ground with footstrike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.\\nEach limb of the lower extremity works opposite to the other.  When one side is in toe-off/propulsion, the other hand is in the swing/recovery phase preparing for footstrike. Following toe-off and the beginning of the initial swing of one side, there is a flight phase where neither extremity is in contact with the ground due to the opposite side finishing terminal swing.  As the footstrike of the one hand occurs, initial swing continues.  The opposing limbs meet with one in midstance and midswing, beginning the propulsion and terminal swing phases.\\n\\nUpper extremity function\\nUpper extremity function serves mainly in providing balance in conjunction with the opposing side of the lower extremity. The movement of each leg is paired with the opposite arm which serves to counterbalance the body, particularly during the stance phase. The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at an approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible. The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing. It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored.  Thus trunk motion should remain mostly stable with little motion except for slight rotation as excessive movement would contribute to transverse motion and wasted energy.\\n\\nFootstrike debate\\nRecent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences, in the potential injury risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes.  It has been shown that heel striking is generally associated with higher rates of injury and impact due to inefficient shock absorption and inefficient biomechanical compensations for these forces. This is due to forces from a heel strike traveling through bones for shock absorption rather than being absorbed by muscles.  Since bones cannot disperse forces easily, the forces are transmitted to other parts of the body, including ligaments, joints and bones in the rest of the lower extremity all the way up to the lower back. This causes the body to use abnormal compensatory motions in an attempt to avoid serious bone injuries. These compensations include internal rotation of the tibia, knee and hip joints.  Excessive amounts of compensation over time have been linked to higher risk of injuries in those joints as well as the muscles involved in those motions. Conversely, a mid/forefoot strike has been associated with greater efficiency and lower injury risk due to the triceps surae being used as a lever system to absorb forces with the muscles eccentrically rather than through the bone. Landing with a mid/forefoot strike has also been shown to not only properly attenuate shock but allows the triceps surae to aid in propulsion via reflexive plantarflexion after stretching to absorb ground contact forces. Thus a mid/forefoot strike may aid in propulsion.\\nHowever, even among elite athletes there are variations in self selected footstrike types. This is especially true in longer distance events, where there is a prevalence of heel strikers. There does tend however to be a greater percentage of mid/forefoot striking runners in the elite fields, particularly in the faster racers and the winning individuals or groups. While one could attribute the faster speeds of elite runners compared to recreational runners with similar footstrikes to physiological differences, the hip and joints have been left out of the equation for proper propulsion.  This brings up the question as to how heel striking elite distance runners are able to keep up such high paces with a supposedly inefficient and injurious foot strike technique.\\n\\nStride length, hip and knee function\\nBiomechanical factors associated with elite runners include increased hip function, use and stride length over recreational runners. An increase in running speeds causes increased ground reaction forces and elite distance runners must compensate for this to maintain their pace over long distances.\\nThese forces are attenuated through increased stride length via increased hip flexion and extension through decreased ground contact time and more force being used in propulsion. With increased propulsion in the horizontal plane, less impact occurs from decreased force in the vertical plane. Increased hip flexion allows for increased use of the hip extensors through midstance and toe-off, allowing for more force production.\\nThe difference even between world-class and national-level 1500-m runners has been associated with more efficient hip joint function. The increase in velocity likely comes from the increased range of motion in hip flexion and extension, allowing for greater acceleration and velocity.  The hip extensors and hip extension have been linked to more powerful knee extension during toe-off, which contributes to propulsion.\\nStride length must be properly increased with some degree of knee flexion maintained through the terminal swing phases, as excessive knee extension during this phase along with footstrike has been associated with higher impact forces due to braking and an increased prevalence of heel striking. Elite runners tend to exhibit some degree of knee flexion at footstrike and midstance, which first serves to eccentrically absorb impact forces in the quadriceps muscle group. Secondly it allows for the knee joint to concentrically contract and provides major aid in propulsion during toe-off as the quadriceps group is capable of produce large amounts of force.\\nRecreational runners have been shown to increase stride length through increased knee extension rather than increased hip flexion as exhibited by elite runners, which serves instead to provide an intense braking motion with each step and decrease the rate and efficiency of knee extension during toe-off, slowing down speed. Knee extension however contributes to additional stride length and propulsion during toe-off and is seen more frequently in elite runners as well.\\n\\nGood technique\\n\\nUpright posture and slight forward lean\\nLeaning forward places a runner\\'s center of mass on the front part of the foot, which avoids landing on the heel and facilitates the use of the spring mechanism of the foot. It also makes it easier for the runner to avoid landing the foot in front of the center of mass and the resultant braking effect. While upright posture is essential, a runner should maintain a relaxed frame and use their core to keep posture upright and stable. This helps prevent injury as long as the body is neither rigid nor tense. The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders.\\n\\nStride rate and types\\nExercise physiologists have found that the stride rates are extremely consistent across professional runners, between 185 and 200 steps per minute. The main difference between long- and short-distance runners is the length of stride rather than the rate of stride.\\n\\nDuring running, the speed at which the runner moves may be calculated by multiplying the cadence (steps per minute) by the stride length. Running is often measured in terms of pace in minutes per mile or kilometer. Different types of stride are necessary for different types of running. When sprinting, runners stay on their toes bringing their legs up, using shorter and faster strides. Long-distance runners tend to have more relaxed strides that vary.\\n\\nHealth benefits\\n\\nCardiovascular \\nWhile there exists the potential for injury while running (just as there is in any sport), there are many benefits. Some of these benefits include potential weight loss, improved cardiovascular and respiratory health (reducing the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases), improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced total blood cholesterol, strengthening of bones (and potentially increased bone density), possible strengthening of the immune system and an improved self-esteem and emotional state. Running, like all forms of regular exercise, can effectively slow or reverse the effects of aging. Even people who have already experienced a heart attack are 20% less likely to develop serious heart problems if more engaged in running or any type of aerobic activity.\\n\\nAlthough an optimal amount of vigorous aerobic exercise such as running might bring benefits related to lower cardiovascular disease and life extension, an excessive dose (e.g., marathons) might have an opposite effect associated with cardiotoxicity.\\n\\nMetabolic \\n\\nRunning can assist people in losing weight, staying in shape and improving body composition. Research suggests that the person of average weight will burn approximately 100 calories per mile run. Running increases one\\'s metabolism, even after running; one will continue to burn an increased level of calories for a short time after the run. Different speeds and distances are appropriate for different individual health and fitness levels. For new runners, it takes time to get into shape. The key is consistency and a slow increase in speed and distance. While running, it is best to pay attention to how one\\'s body feels. If a runner is gasping for breath or feels exhausted while running, it may be beneficial to slow down or try a shorter distance for a few weeks. If a runner feels that the pace or distance is no longer challenging, then the runner may want to speed up or run farther.\\n\\nMental  \\nRunning can also have psychological benefits, as many participants in the sport report feeling an elated, euphoric state, often referred to as a \"runner\\'s high\". Running is frequently recommended as therapy for people with clinical depression and people coping with addiction. A possible benefit may be the enjoyment of nature and scenery, which also improves psychological well-being (see Ecopsychology § Practical benefits).\\n\\nIn animal models, running has been shown to increase the number of newly created neurons within the brain. This finding could have significant implications in aging as well as learning and memory. A recent study published in Cell Metabolism has also linked running with improved memory and learning skills.\\n\\nRunning is an effective way to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and tension. It helps people who struggle with seasonal affective disorder by running outside when it is sunny and warm. Running can improve mental alertness and also improves sleep. Both research and clinical experience have shown that exercise can be a treatment for serious depression and anxiety even some physicians prescribe exercise to most of their patients. Running can have a longer lasting effect than anti-depressants.\\n\\nInjuries\\n\\nHigh impact \\n\\nMany injuries are associated with running because of its high-impact nature. Change in running volume may lead to development of patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, plica syndrome, and medial tibial stress syndrome. Change in running pace may cause Achilles Tendinitis, gastrocnemius injuries, and plantar fasciitis. Repetitive stress on the same tissues without enough time for recovery or running with improper form can lead to many of the above. Runners generally attempt to minimize these injuries by warming up before exercise, focusing on proper running form, performing strength training exercises, eating a well balanced diet, allowing time for recovery, and \"icing\" (applying ice to sore muscles or taking an ice bath).\\n\\nSome runners may experience injuries when running on concrete surfaces. The problem with running on concrete is that the body adjusts to this flat surface running, and some of the muscles will become weaker, along with the added impact of running on a harder surface. Therefore, it can be beneficial to change terrain occasionally – such as trail, beach, or grass running. This is more unstable ground and allows the legs to strengthen different muscles. Runners should be wary of twisting their ankles on such terrain. Running downhill also increases knee stress and should, therefore, be avoided. Reducing the frequency and duration can also prevent injury.\\n\\nBarefoot running has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries, but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury. However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.\\n\\nChafing \\n\\nAnother common, running-related injury is chafing, caused by repetitive rubbing of one piece of skin against another, or against an article of clothing. One common location for chafe to occur is the runner\\'s upper thighs. The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look. A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems. Chafe is also likely to occur on the nipple. There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with chafing while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction. Prevention is key which is why form fitting clothes are important.\\n\\nIliotibial band syndrome \\nAn iliotibial band is a muscle and tendon that is attached to the hip and runs the length of the thigh to attach to the upper part of the tibia, and the band is what helps the knee to bend. This is an injury that is located at the knee and shows symptoms of swelling outside the knee. Iliotibial band syndrome is also known as \"runner\\'s knee\" or \"jogger\\'s knee\" because it can be caused by jogging or running. Once pain or swelling is noticeable it is important to put ice on it immediately and it is recommended to rest the knee for better healing. Most knee injuries can be treated by light activity and much rest for the knee. In more serious cases, arthroscopy is the most common to help repair ligaments but severe situations reconstructive surgery would be needed. A survey was taken in 2011 with knee injuries being 22.7% of the most common injuries.\\n\\nMedial tibial stress syndrome \\nA more known injury is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) which is the accurate name for shin splints. This is caused during running when the muscle is being overused along the front of the lower leg with symptoms that affect 2 to 6 inches of the muscle. Shin Splints have sharp, splinter-like pain, that is typically X-rayed by doctors but is not necessary for shin splints to be diagnosed. To help prevent shin splints it is commonly known to stretch before and after a workout session, and also avoid heavy equipment especially during the first couple of workout sessions. Also to help prevent shin splints don\\'t increase the intensity of a workout more than 10% a week. To treat shin splints it is important to rest with the least amount of impact on your legs and apply ice to the area. A survey showed that shin splints make up 12.7% of the most common injuries in running, with blisters being the top percentage at 30.9%.\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nRunning is both a competition and a type of training for sports that have running or endurance components. As a sport, it is split into events divided by distance and sometimes includes permutations such as the obstacles in steeplechase and hurdles. Running races are contests to determine which of the competitors is able to run a certain distance in the shortest time. Today, competitive running events make up the core of the sport of athletics. Events are usually grouped into several classes, each requiring substantially different athletic strengths and involving different tactics, training methods, and types of competitors.\\n\\nRunning competitions have probably existed for most of humanity\\'s history and were a key part of the ancient Olympic Games as well as the modern Olympics. The activity of running went through a period of widespread popularity in the United States during the running boom of the 1970s. Over the next two decades, as many as 25 million Americans were doing some form of running or jogging – accounting for roughly one tenth of the population. Today, road racing is a popular sport among non-professional athletes, who included over 7.7\\xa0million people in America alone in 2002.\\n\\nLimits of speed\\n\\nFootspeed, or sprint speed, is the maximum speed at which a human can run. It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports.\\n\\nThe fastest human footspeed on record is 44.7\\xa0km/h (12.4\\xa0m/s, 27.8\\xa0mph), seen during a 100-meter sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by Usain Bolt.\\n\\nSpeed over increasing distance based on world record times \\n(see :Category:Athletics (track and field) record progressions)\\n\\nTypes\\nTrack\\n\\nTrack running events are individual or relay events with athletes racing over specified distances on an oval running track. The events are categorized as sprints, middle and long-distance, and hurdling.\\n\\nRoad\\n\\nRoad running takes place on a measured course over an established road (as opposed to track and cross country running). These events normally range from distances of 5 kilometers to longer distances such as half marathons and marathons, and they may involve scores of runners or wheelchair entrants.\\n\\nCross-country\\n\\nCross country running takes place over the open or rough terrain. The courses used for these events may include grass, mud, woodlands, hills, flat ground and water. It is a popular participatory sport and is one of the events which, along with track and field, road running, and racewalking, makes up the umbrella sport of athletics.\\n\\nVertical\\n\\nThe majority of popular races do not incorporate a significant change in elevation as a key component of a course. There are several, disparate variations that feature significant inclines or declines. These fall into two main groups.\\n\\nThe naturalistic group is based on outdoor racing over geographical features. Among these are the cross country-related sports of fell running (a tradition associated with Northern Europe) and trail running (mainly ultramarathon distances), the running/climbing combination of skyrunning (organised by the International Skyrunning Federation with races across North America, Europe and East Asia) and the mainly trail- and road-centred mountain running (governed by the World Mountain Running Association and based mainly in Europe).\\n\\nThe second variety of vertical running is based on human structures, such as stairs and man-made slopes. The foremost type of this is tower running, which sees athletes compete indoors, running up steps within very tall structures such as the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building.\\n\\nDistances\\n\\nSprints\\n\\nSprints are short running events in athletics and track and field. Races over short distances are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event – the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. There are three sprinting events which are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100\\xa0m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200\\xa0m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400\\xa0m was the successor to the 440-yard dash or quarter-mile race.\\n\\nAt the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the contest progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400\\xa0m indoors. Races up to 100\\xa0m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete\\'s maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner\\'s near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so as lactic acid builds up, and leg muscles begin to be deprived of oxygen.\\n\\nThe 60 metres is a common indoor event and it an indoor world championship event. Other less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres and 500 metres which are used in some high and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, is rarely competed: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea\\'s record in 2009.\\n\\nMiddle distance\\n\\nMiddle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints up to 3000 metres. The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880-yard run, or half-mile, was the forebear to the 800\\xa0m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500\\xa0m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500\\xa0m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 1900s.\\n\\nLong distance\\n\\nExamples of longer-distance running events are long-distance track races, half marathons, marathons, ultramarathons, and multiday races.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Global Running Day\\n Level and incline running\\n List of people killed while running\\n Outline of running\\n Plogging\\n Running energetics\\n Trail running\\n Ultra Running\\n Skyrunning\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nArticles containing video clips\\nEndurance games\\nTerrestrial locomotion',\n",
       "       'A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material.\\n\\nA large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter, which is more difficult to digest than animal prey. This flora is made up of cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria.\\n\\nEtymology\\nHerbivore is the anglicized form of a modern Latin coinage, herbivora, cited in Charles Lyell\\'s 1830 Principles of Geology. Richard Owen employed the anglicized term in an 1854 work on fossil teeth and skeletons. Herbivora is derived from Latin herba \\'small plant, herb\\' and vora, from vorare \\'to eat, devour\\'.\\n\\nDefinition and related terms\\nHerbivory is a form of consumption in which an organism principally eats autotrophs such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria.  More generally, organisms that feed on autotrophs in general are known as primary consumers.\\nHerbivory is usually limited to animals that eat plants. Fungi, bacteria, and protists that feed on living plants are usually termed plant pathogens (plant diseases), while fungi and microbes that feed on dead plants are described as saprotrophs. Flowering plants that obtain nutrition from other living plants are usually termed parasitic plants. There is, however, no single exclusive and definitive ecological classification of consumption patterns; each textbook has its own variations on the theme.\\n\\nEvolution of herbivory\\n\\nThe understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defence (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; the observation of plant debris in fossilised animal faeces; and the construction of herbivore mouthparts.\\n\\nAlthough herbivory was long thought to be a Mesozoic phenomenon, fossils have shown that plants were being consumed by arthropods within less than 20\\xa0million years after the first land plants evolved. Insects fed on the spores of early Devonian plants, and the Rhynie chert also provides evidence that organisms fed on plants using a \"pierce and suck\" technique.\\n\\nDuring the next 75\\xa0million years, plants evolved a range of more complex organs, such as roots and seeds. There is no evidence of any organism being fed upon until the middle-late Mississippian, . There was a gap of 50 to 100\\xa0million years between the time each organ evolved and the time organisms evolved to feed upon them; this may be due to the low levels of oxygen during this period, which may have suppressed evolution. Further than their arthropod status, the identity of these early herbivores is uncertain.\\nHole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.\\n\\nHerbivory among four-limbed terrestrial vertebrates, the tetrapods, developed in the Late Carboniferous (307–299\\xa0million years ago). Early tetrapods were large amphibious piscivores. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and insects, some reptiles began exploring two new food types, tetrapods (carnivory) and plants (herbivory). The entire dinosaur order ornithischia was composed of herbivorous dinosaurs. Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation. In contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials.\\n\\nArthropods evolved herbivory in four phases, changing their approach to it in response to changing plant communities.Tetrapod herbivores made their first appearance in the fossil record of their jaws near the Permio-Carboniferous boundary, approximately 300\\xa0million years ago.  The earliest evidence of their herbivory has been attributed to dental occlusion, the process in which teeth from the upper jaw come in contact with teeth in the lower jaw is present. The evolution of dental occlusion led to a drastic increase in plant food processing and provides evidence about feeding strategies based on tooth wear patterns. Examination of phylogenetic frameworks of tooth and jaw morphologes has revealed that dental occlusion developed independently in several lineages tetrapod herbivores. This suggests that evolution and spread occurred simultaneously within various lineages.\\n\\nFood chain\\n\\nHerbivores form an important link in the food chain because they consume plants to digest the carbohydrates photosynthetically produced by a plant. Carnivores in turn consume herbivores for the same reason, while omnivores can obtain their nutrients from either plants or animals.  Due to a herbivore\\'s ability to survive solely on tough and fibrous plant matter, they are termed the primary consumers in the food cycle (chain).  Herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory can be regarded as special cases of consumer–resource interactions.\\n\\nFeeding strategies\\n\\nTwo herbivore feeding strategies are grazing (e.g. cows) and browsing (e.g. moose). For a terrestrial mammal to be called a grazer, at least 90% of the forage has to be grass, and for a browser at least 90% tree leaves and twigs. An intermediate feeding strategy is called \"mixed-feeding\". In their daily need to take up energy from forage, herbivores of different body mass may be selective in choosing their food.  \"Selective\" means that herbivores may choose their forage source depending on, e.g., season or food availability, but also that they may choose high quality (and consequently highly nutritious) forage before lower quality. The latter especially is determined by the body mass of the herbivore, with small herbivores selecting for high-quality forage, and with increasing body mass animals are less selective. Several theories attempt to explain and quantify the relationship between animals and their food, such as Kleiber\\'s law, Holling\\'s disk equation and the marginal value theorem (see below).\\n\\nKleiber\\'s law describes the relationship between an animal\\'s size and its feeding strategy, saying that larger animals need to eat less food per unit weight than smaller animals. Kleiber\\'s law states that the metabolic rate (q0) of an animal is the mass of the animal (M) raised to the 3/4 power: q0=M3/4\\nTherefore, the mass of the animal increases at a faster rate than the metabolic rate.\\n\\nHerbivores employ numerous types of feeding strategies. Many herbivores do not fall into one specific feeding strategy, but employ several strategies and eat a variety of plant parts.\\n\\nOptimal Foraging Theory is a model for predicting animal behavior while looking for food or other resources, such as shelter or water.  This model assesses both individual movement, such as animal behavior while looking for food, and distribution within a habitat, such as dynamics at the population and community level.  For example, the model would be used to look at the browsing behavior of a deer while looking for food, as well as that deer\\'s specific location and movement within the forested habitat and its interaction with other deer while in that habitat.\\n\\nThis model has been criticized as circular and untestable. Critics have pointed out that its proponents use examples that fit the theory, but do not use the model when it does not fit the reality. Other critics point out that animals do not have the ability to assess and maximize their potential gains, therefore the optimal foraging theory is irrelevant and derived to explain trends that do not exist in nature.\\n\\nHolling\\'s disk equation models the efficiency at which predators consume prey. The model predicts that as the number of prey increases, the amount of time predators spend handling prey also increases, and therefore the efficiency of the predator decreases. In 1959, S. Holling proposed an equation to model the rate of return for an optimal diet: Rate (R )=Energy gained in foraging (Ef)/(time searching (Ts) + time handling (Th))\\n\\nWhere s=cost of search per unit time f=rate of encounter with items, h=handling time, e=energy gained per encounter\\nIn effect, this would indicate that a herbivore in a dense forest would spend more time handling (eating) the vegetation because there was so much vegetation around than a herbivore in a sparse forest, who could easily browse through the forest vegetation. According to the Holling\\'s disk equation, a herbivore in the sparse forest would be more efficient at eating than the herbivore in the dense forest.\\n\\nThe marginal value theorem describes the balance between eating all the food in a patch for immediate energy, or moving to a new patch and leaving the plants in the first patch to regenerate for future use. The theory predicts that absent complicating factors, an animal should leave a resource patch when the rate of payoff (amount of food) falls below the average rate of payoff for the entire area. According to this theory, an animal should move to a new patch of food when the patch they are currently feeding on requires more energy to obtain food than an average patch. Within this theory, two subsequent parameters emerge, the Giving Up Density (GUD) and the Giving Up Time (GUT).  The Giving Up Density (GUD) quantifies the amount of food that remains in a patch when a forager moves to a new patch. The Giving Up Time (GUT) is used when an animal continuously assesses the patch quality.\\n\\nPlant-herbivore interactions\\nInteractions between plants and herbivores can play a prevalent role in ecosystem dynamics such community structure and functional processes. Plant diversity and distribution is often driven by herbivory, and it is likely that trade-offs between plant competitiveness and defensiveness, and between colonization and mortality allow for coexistence between species in the presence of herbivores. However, the effects of herbivory on plant diversity and richness is variable. For example, increased abundance of herbivores such as deer decrease plant diversity and species richness, while other large mammalian herbivores like bison control dominant species which allows other species to flourish. \\xa0Plant-herbivore interactions can also operate so that plant communities mediate herbivore communities. Plant communities that are more diverse typically sustain greater herbivore richness by providing a greater and more diverse set of resources.\\n\\nCoevolution and phylogenetic correlation between herbivores and plants are important aspects of the influence of herbivore and plant interactions on communities and ecosystem functioning, especially in regard to herbivorous insects. This is apparent in the adaptations plants develop to tolerate and/or defend from insect herbivory and the responses of herbivores to overcome these adaptations. The evolution of antagonistic and mutualistic plant-herbivore interactions are not mutually exclusive and may co-occur. Plant phylogeny has been found to facilitate the colonization and community assembly of herbivores, and there is evidence of phylogenetic linkage between plant beta diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity of insect clades such as butterflies. These types of eco-evolutionary feedbacks between plants and herbivores are likely the main driving force behind plant and herbivore diversity.\\n\\nAbiotic factors such as climate and biogeographical features also impact plant-herbivore communities and interactions. For example, in temperate freshwater wetlands herbivorous waterfowl communities change according to season, with species that eat above-ground vegetation being abundant during summer, and species that forage below-ground being present in winter months. These seasonal herbivore communities differ in both their assemblage and functions within the wetland ecosystem. Such differences in herbivore modalities can potentially lead to trade-offs that influence species traits and may lead to additive effects on community composition and ecosystem functioning. Seasonal changes and environmental gradients such as elevation and latitude often affect the palatability of plants which in turn influences herbivore community assemblages and vice versa. Examples include a decrease in abundance of leaf-chewing larvae in the fall when hardwood leaf palatability decreases due to increased tannin levels which results in a decline of arthropod species richness, and increased palatability of plant communities at higher elevations where grasshoppers abundances are lower. Climatic stressors such as ocean acidification can lead to responses in plant-herbivore interactions in relation to palatability as well.\\n\\nHerbivore offense\\n\\nThe myriad defenses displayed by plants means that their herbivores need a variety of skills to overcome these defenses and obtain food. These allow herbivores to increase their feeding and use of a host plant. Herbivores have three primary strategies for dealing with plant defenses: choice, herbivore modification, and plant modification.\\n\\nFeeding choice involves which plants a herbivore chooses to consume. It has been suggested that many herbivores feed on a variety of plants to balance their nutrient uptake and to avoid consuming too much of any one type of defensive chemical. This involves a tradeoff however, between foraging on many plant species to avoid toxins or specializing on one type of plant that can be detoxified.\\n\\nHerbivore modification is when various adaptations to body or digestive systems of the herbivore allow them to overcome plant defenses. This might include detoxifying secondary metabolites, sequestering toxins unaltered, or avoiding toxins, such as through the production of large amounts of saliva to reduce effectiveness of defenses. Herbivores may also utilize symbionts to evade plant defenses. For example, some aphids use bacteria in their gut to provide essential amino acids lacking in their sap diet.\\n\\nPlant modification occurs when herbivores manipulate their plant prey to increase feeding. For example, some caterpillars roll leaves to reduce the effectiveness of plant defenses activated by sunlight.\\n\\nPlant defense\\n\\nA plant defense is a trait that increases plant fitness when faced with herbivory. This is measured relative to another plant that lacks the defensive trait. Plant defenses increase survival and/or reproduction (fitness) of plants under pressure of predation from herbivores.\\n\\nDefense can be divided into two main categories, tolerance and resistance. Tolerance is the ability of a plant to withstand damage without a reduction in fitness. This can occur by diverting herbivory to non-essential plant parts, resource allocation, compensatory growth, or by rapid regrowth and recovery from herbivory. Resistance refers to the ability of a plant to reduce the amount of damage it receives from herbivores. This can occur via avoidance in space or time, physical defenses, or chemical defenses. Defenses can either be constitutive, always present in the plant, or induced, produced or translocated by the plant following damage or stress.\\n\\nPhysical, or mechanical, defenses are barriers or structures designed to deter herbivores or reduce intake rates, lowering overall herbivory. Thorns such as those found on roses or acacia trees are one example, as are the spines on a cactus. Smaller hairs known as trichomes may cover leaves or stems and are especially effective against invertebrate herbivores. In addition, some plants have waxes or resins that alter their texture, making them difficult to eat. Also the incorporation of silica into cell walls is analogous to that of the role of lignin in that it is a compression-resistant structural component of cell walls; so that plants with their cell walls impregnated with silica are thereby afforded a measure of protection against herbivory.\\n\\nChemical defenses are secondary metabolites produced by the plant that deter herbivory. There are a wide variety of these in nature and a single plant can have hundreds of different chemical defenses. Chemical defenses can be divided into two main groups, carbon-based defenses and nitrogen-based defenses.\\n\\nCarbon-based defenses include terpenes and phenolics. Terpenes are derived from 5-carbon isoprene units and comprise essential oils, carotenoids, resins, and latex. They can have several functions that disrupt herbivores such as inhibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation, molting hormones, or the nervous system. Phenolics combine an aromatic carbon ring with a hydroxyl group. There are several different phenolics such as lignins, which are found in cell walls and are very indigestible except for specialized microorganisms; tannins, which have a bitter taste and bind to proteins making them indigestible; and furanocumerins, which produce free radicals disrupting DNA, protein, and lipids, and can cause skin irritation.\\nNitrogen-based defenses are synthesized from amino acids and primarily come in the form of alkaloids and cyanogens. Alkaloids include commonly recognized substances such as caffeine, nicotine, and morphine. These compounds are often bitter and can inhibit DNA or RNA synthesis or block nervous system signal transmission. Cyanogens get their name from the cyanide stored within their tissues. This is released when the plant is damaged and inhibits cellular respiration and electron transport.\\n\\nPlants have also changed features that enhance the probability of attracting natural enemies to herbivores. Some emit semiochemicals, odors that attract natural enemies, while others provide food and housing to maintain the natural enemies\\' presence, e.g. ants that reduce herbivory.\\nA given plant species often has many types of defensive mechanisms, mechanical or chemical, constitutive or induced, which allow it to escape from herbivores.\\n\\nPredator–Prey Theory\\nAccording to the theory of predator–prey interactions, the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic. When prey (plants) are numerous their predators (herbivores) increase in numbers, reducing the prey population, which in turn causes predator number to decline. The prey population eventually recovers, starting a new cycle.  This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source, in this case, the plant.\\n\\nSeveral factors play into these fluctuating populations and help stabilize predator-prey dynamics. For example, spatial heterogeneity is maintained, which means there will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores. This stabilizing dynamic plays an especially important role for specialist herbivores that feed on one species of plant and prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source. Prey defenses also help stabilize predator-prey dynamics, and for more information on these relationships see the section on Plant Defenses.  Eating a second prey type helps herbivores\\' populations stabilize. Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore, while the populations of the plants oscillate. This plays an important role for generalist herbivores that eat a variety of plants.  Keystone herbivores keep vegetation populations in check and allow for a greater diversity of both herbivores and plants. When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system, the balance is thrown off and the diversity can collapse to a monotaxon system.\\n\\nThe back and forth relationship of plant defense and herbivore offense drives coevolution between plants and herbivores, resulting in a \"coevolutionary arms race\". The escape and radiation mechanisms for coevolution, presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants, has been the driving force behind speciation.\\n\\nMutualism \\nWhile much of the interaction of herbivory and plant defense is negative, with one individual reducing the fitness of the other, some is beneficial. This beneficial herbivory takes the form of mutualisms in which both partners benefit in some way from the interaction. Seed dispersal by herbivores and pollination are two forms of mutualistic herbivory in which the herbivore receives a food resource and the plant is aided in reproduction. Plants can also be indirectly affected by herbivores through nutrient recycling, with plants benefiting from herbivores when nutrients are recycled very efficiently. Another form of plant-herbivore mutualism is physical changes to the environment and/or plant community structure by herbivores which serve as ecosystem engineers, such as wallowing by bison. Swans form a mutual relationship with the plant species that they forage by digging and disturbing the sediment which removes competing plants and subsequently allows colonization of other plant species.\\n\\nImpacts\\n\\nTrophic Cascades and Environmental Degradation \\nWhen herbivores are affected by trophic cascades, plant communities can be indirectly affected. Often these effects are felt when predator populations decline and herbivore populations are no longer limited, which leads to intense herbivore foraging which can suppress plant communities. Environmental degradation from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the US alone has the potential to both change vegetative communities through over-browsing and cost forest restoration projects upwards of $750\\xa0million annually.   Another example of a trophic cascade involved plant-herbivore interactions are coral reef ecosystems. Herbivorous fish and marine animals are important algae and seaweed grazers, and in the absence of plant-eating fish, corals are outcompeted and seaweeds deprive corals of sunlight.\\n\\nEconomic Impacts \\nAgricultural crop damage by the same species totals approximately $100\\xa0million every year. Insect crop damages also contribute largely to annual crop losses in the U.S. Herbivores also affect economics through the revenue generated by hunting and ecotourism.  For example, the hunting of herbivorous game species such as white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, antelope, and elk in the U.S. contributes greatly to the billion-dollar annually, hunting industry.  Ecotourism is a major source of revenue, particularly in Africa, where many large mammalian herbivores such as elephants, zebras, and giraffes help to bring in the equivalent of millions of US dollars to various nations annually.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Consumer-resource systems\\n List of feeding behaviours\\n List of herbivorous animals\\n Plant-based diet\\n Productivity (ecology)\\n Seed predation\\n Tritrophic interactions in plant defense\\n Herbivore men\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n Bob Strauss, 2008, Herbivorous Dinosaurs, The New York Times\\nDanell, K., R.

       "       'Echolocation, also called bio sonar, is a biological sonar used by several animal species.\\nEcholocating animals emit calls out to the environment \\nand listen to the echoes of those calls that return from various objects near them. They use these echoes to locate and identify the objects. Echolocation is used for navigation, foraging, and hunting in various environments.\\n\\nEcholocating animals include some mammals (most notably Laurasiatheria) and a few birds. Especially some bat species and odontocetes (toothed whales and dolphins), but also in simpler forms in other groups such as shrews, and two cave dwelling bird groups, the so-called cave swiftlets in the genus Aerodramus (formerly Collocalia) and the unrelated Oilbird Steatornis caripensis.\\n\\nEarly research \\n\\nThe term echolocation was coined in 1938 by the American zoologist Donald Griffin, who, with Robert Galambos, first demonstrated the phenomenon in bats. As Griffin described in his book, the 18th century Italian scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani had, by means of a series of elaborate experiments, concluded that when bats fly at night, they rely on some sense besides vision, but he did not discover that the other sense was hearing. The Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine repeated Spallanzani\\'s experiments (using different species of bat), and concluded that when bats hunt at night, they rely on hearing. In 1908, Walter Louis Hahn confirmed Spallanzani\\'s and Jurine\\'s findings.\\n\\nIn 1912, the inventor Hiram Maxim independently proposed that bats used sound below the human auditory range to avoid obstacles. In 1920, the English physiologist Hamilton Hartridge correctly proposed instead that bats used frequencies above the range of human hearing.\\n\\nEcholocation in odontocetes (toothed whales) was not properly described until two decades after Griffin and Galambos\\' work, by Schevill and McBride in 1956. However, in 1953, Jacques Yves Cousteau suggested in his first book, The Silent World, that porpoises had something like sonar, judging by their navigational abilities.\\n\\nPrinciple \\n\\nEcholocation is the same as active sonar, using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal\\'s own sound emission and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.\\n\\nUnlike some human-made sonars that rely on many extremely narrow beams and many receivers to localize a target (multibeam sonar), animal echolocation has only one transmitter and two receivers (the ears) positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to the ears arrive at different times and at different intensities, depending on the position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudness differences are used by the animals to perceive distance and direction. With echolocation, the bat or other animal can see not only where it is going but also how big another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features.\\n\\nAt the most basic level, echolocation is based on the neural anatomy of auditory brain circuitry. In essence, ascending brain pathways in the brain stem allow the brain to calculate the difference between the two ears to very small fractions of a second.\\n\\nBats\\n\\nEcholocating bats use echolocation to navigate and forage, often in total darkness. They generally emerge from their roosts in caves, attics, or trees at dusk and hunt for insects into the night. Using echolocation, bats can determine how far away an object is, the object\\'s size, shape and density, and the direction (if any) that an object is moving. Their use of echolocation, along with powered flight, allows them to occupy a niche where there are often many insects (that come out at night since there are fewer predators then), less competition for food, and fewer species that may prey on the bats themselves.\\n\\nEcholocating bats generate ultrasound via the larynx and emit the sound through the open mouth or, much more rarely, the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Bat echolocation calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000\\xa0Hz, mostly beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20\\xa0Hz to 20,000\\xa0Hz). Bats may estimate the elevation of targets by interpreting the interference patterns caused by the echoes reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.\\n\\nThere are two hypotheses about the evolution of echolocation in bats. The first suggests that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice, or more, in Chiroptera, at least once in the Yangochiroptera and at least once in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae). The second proposes that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae.  Later, the genus Rousettus in the Pteropodidae family developed a different mechanism of echolocation using a system of tongue-clicking.\\n\\nIndividual bat species echolocate within specific frequency ranges that suit their environment and prey types. This has sometimes been used by researchers to identify bats flying in an area simply by recording their calls with ultrasonic recorders known as \"bat detectors\". However echolocation calls are not always species specific and some bats overlap in the type of calls they use so recordings of echolocation calls cannot be used to identify all bats. In recent years researchers in several countries have developed \"bat call libraries\" that contain recordings of local bat species that have been identified known as \"reference calls\" to assist with identification.\\n\\nSince the 1970s there has been an ongoing controversy among researchers as to whether bats use a form of processing known from radar termed coherent cross-correlation. Coherence means that the phase of the echolocation signals is used by the bats, while cross-correlation just implies that the outgoing signal is compared with the returning echoes in a running process. Today most – but not all – researchers believe that they use cross-correlation, but in an incoherent form, termed a filter bank receiver.\\n\\nWhen searching for prey they produce sounds at a low rate (10–20 clicks/second). During the search phase the sound emission is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This coupling appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats. After detecting a potential prey item, echolocating bats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the terminal buzz, at rates as high as 200 clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.\\n\\nCalls and ecology\\n\\nEcholocating bats occupy a diverse set of ecological conditions ; they can be found living in environments as different as Europe and Madagascar, and hunting for food sources as different as insects, frogs, nectar, fruit, and blood. Additionally, the characteristics of an echolocation call are adapted to the particular environment, hunting behavior, and food source of the particular bat. However, this adaptation of echolocation calls to ecological factors is constrained by the phylogenetic relationship of the bats, leading to a process known as descent with modification, and resulting in the diversity of the Chiroptera today.\\n\\nFlying insects are a common source of food for echolocating bats and some insects (moths in particular) can hear the calls of predatory bats. There is evidence that moth hearing has evolved in response to bat echolocation to avoid capture. Furthermore, these moth adaptations provide selective pressure for bats to improve their insect-hunting systems and this cycle culminates in a moth-bat \"evolutionary arms race.\"\\n\\nAcoustic features\\n\\nDescribing the diversity of bat echolocation calls requires examination of the frequency and temporal features of the calls. It is the variations in these aspects that produce echolocation calls suited for different acoustic environments and hunting behaviors.\\n\\nFrequency\\n\\nBat call frequencies range from as low as 11\\xa0kHz to as high as 212\\xa0kHz. Insectivorous aerial-hawking bats have a call frequency between 20\\xa0kHz and 60\\xa0kHz because it is the frequency that gives the best range and image acuity and makes them less conspicuous to insects. However, low frequencies are adaptive for some species with different prey and environments. Euderma maculatum, a species that feeds on moths, uses a particularly low frequency of 12.7\\xa0kHz that cannot be heard by moths.\\n\\nFrequency modulation and constant frequency\\n\\nEcholocation calls can be composed of two different types of frequency structure: frequency modulated (FM) sweeps, and constant frequency (CF) tones. A particular call can consist of one, the other, or both structures.  An FM sweep is a broadband signal – that is, it contains a downward sweep through a range of frequencies. A CF tone is a narrowband signal:  the sound stays constant at one frequency throughout its duration.\\n\\nIntensity\\n\\nEcholocation calls have been measured at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 decibels. Certain bat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity as they approach objects that reflect sound strongly.  This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat. High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133\\xa0dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects\\' size only provide a small target for sound reflection. Additionally, the so-called \"whispering bats\" have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.\\n\\nHarmonic composition\\n\\nCalls can be composed of one frequency or multiple frequencies comprising a harmonic series.  In the latter case, the call is usually dominated by a certain harmonic (\"dominant\" frequencies are those present at higher intensities than other harmonics present in the call).\\n\\nCall duration\\n\\nA single echolocation call (a call being a single continuous trace on a sound spectrogram, and a series of calls comprising a sequence or pass) can last anywhere from 0.2 to 100 milliseconds in duration, depending on the stage of prey-catching behavior that the bat is engaged in.  For example, the duration of a call usually decreases when the bat is in the final stages of prey capture – this enables the bat to call more rapidly without overlap of call and echo. Reducing duration comes at the cost of having less total sound available for reflecting off objects and being heard by the bat.\\n\\nPulse interval\\n\\nThe time interval between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines two aspects of a bat\\'s perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat\\'s auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the pulse interval) as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target\\'s location at a faster rate when it needs it most. Secondly, the pulse interval determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a pulse interval of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a pulse interval of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85\\xa0cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.\\n\\nFM signal advantages\\n\\nThe major advantage conferred by an FM signal is extremely precise range discrimination, or localization, of the target.  J.A. Simmons demonstrated this effect with a series of elegant experiments that showed how bats using FM signals could distinguish between two separate targets even when the targets were less than half a millimeter apart.  This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. Additionally, if harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.\\n\\nOne possible disadvantage of the FM signal is a decreased operational range of the call.  Because the energy of the call is spread out among many frequencies, the distance at which the FM-bat can detect targets is limited. This is in part because any echo returning at a particular frequency can only be evaluated for a brief fraction of a millisecond, as the fast downward sweep of the call does not remain at any one frequency for long.\\n\\nCF signal advantages\\n\\nThe structure of a CF signal is adaptive in that it allows the CF-bat to detect both the velocity of a target, and the fluttering of a target\\'s wings as Doppler shifted frequencies.  A Doppler shift is an alteration in sound wave frequency, and is produced in two relevant situations:  when the bat and its target are moving relative to each other, and when the target\\'s wings are oscillating back and forth. CF-bats must compensate for Doppler shifts, lowering the frequency of their call in response to echoes of elevated frequency – this ensures that the returning echo remains at the frequency to which the ears of the bat are most finely tuned.  The oscillation of a target\\'s wings also produces amplitude shifts, which gives a CF-bat additional help in distinguishing a flying target from a stationary one.\\n\\nAdditionally, because the signal energy of a CF call is concentrated into a narrow frequency band, the operational range of the call is much greater than that of an FM signal.  This relies on the fact that echoes returning within the narrow frequency band can be summed over the entire length of the call, which maintains a constant frequency for up to 100 milliseconds.\\n\\nAcoustic environments of FM and CF signals\\n\\nA frequency modulated (FM) component is excellent for hunting prey while flying in close, cluttered environments.  Two aspects of the FM signal account for this fact:  the precise target localization conferred by the broadband signal, and the short duration of the call.  The first of these is essential because in a cluttered environment, the bats must be able to resolve their prey from large amounts of background noise.  The 3D localization abilities of the broadband signal enable the bat to do exactly that, providing it with what Simmons and Stein (1980) call a \"clutter rejection strategy.\"  This strategy is further improved by the use of harmonics, which, as previously stated, enhance the localization properties of the call.  The short duration of the FM call is also best in close, cluttered environments because it enables the bat to emit many calls extremely rapidly without overlap. This means that the bat can get an almost continuous stream of information – essential when objects are close, because they will pass by quickly – without confusing which echo corresponds to which call.\\n\\nA constant frequency (CF) component is often used by bats hunting for prey while flying in open, clutter-free environments, or by bats that wait on perches for their prey to appear.  The success of the former strategy is due to two aspects of the CF call, both of which confer excellent prey-detection abilities.  First, the greater working range of the call allows bats to detect targets present at great distances – a common situation in open environments.  Second, the length of the call is also suited for targets at great distances:  in this case, there is a decreased chance that the long call will overlap with the returning echo.  The latter strategy is made possible by the fact that the long, narrowband call allows the bat to detect Doppler shifts, which would be produced by an insect moving either towards or away from a perched bat.\\n\\nNeural mechanisms\\n\\nBecause bats use echolocation to orient themselves and to locate objects, their auditory systems are adapted for this purpose, highly specialized for sensing and interpreting the stereotyped echolocation calls characteristic of their own species.  This specialization is evident from the inner ear up to the highest levels of information processing in the auditory cortex.\\n\\nInner ear and primary sensory neurons\\n\\nBoth CF and FM bats have specialized inner ears which allow them to hear sounds in the ultrasonic range, far outside the range of human hearing.  Although in most other aspects, the bat\\'s auditory organs are similar to those of most other mammals, certain bats (horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus spp. and the moustached bat, Pteronotus parnelii) with a constant frequency (CF) component to their call (known as high duty cycle bats) do have a few additional adaptations for detecting the predominant frequency (and harmonics) of the CF vocalization. These include a narrow frequency \"tuning\" of the inner ear organs, with an especially large area responding to the frequency of the bat\\'s returning echoes.\\n\\nThe basilar membrane within the cochlea contains the first of these specializations for echo information processing.  In bats that use CF signals, the section of the membrane that responds to the frequency of returning echoes is much larger than the region of response for any other frequency.  For example, in the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, there is a disproportionately lengthened and thickened section of the membrane that responds to sounds around 83\\xa0kHz, the constant frequency of the echo produced by the bat\\'s call.  This area of high sensitivity to a specific, narrow range of frequency is known as an \"acoustic fovea\".\\n\\nOdontocetes (toothed whales and dolphins) have similar cochlear specializations to those found in bats. Odontocetes also have the highest neural investment of any cochleae reported to date with ratios of greater than 1500 ganglion cells/mm of basilar membrane.\\n\\nFurther along the auditory pathway, the movement of the basilar membrane results in the stimulation of primary auditory neurons.  Many of these neurons are specifically \"tuned\" (respond most strongly) to the narrow frequency range of returning echoes of CF calls.  Because of the large size of the acoustic fovea, the number of neurons responding to this region, and thus to the echo frequency, is especially high.\\n\\nInferior colliculus\\n\\nIn the Inferior colliculus, a structure in the bat\\'s midbrain, information from lower in the auditory processing pathway is integrated and sent on to the auditory cortex. As George Pollak and others showed in a series of papers in 1977, the interneurons in this region have a very high level of sensitivity to time differences, since the time delay between a call and the returning echo tells the bat its distance from the target object. While most neurons respond more quickly to stronger stimuli, collicular neurons maintain their timing accuracy even as signal intensity changes.\\n\\nThese interneurons are specialized for time sensitivity in several ways.  First, when activated, they generally respond with only one or two action potentials.  This short duration of response allows their action potentials to give a very specific indication of the exact moment of the time when the stimulus arrived, and to respond accurately to stimuli that occur close in time to one another.  In addition, the neurons have a very low threshold of activation – they respond quickly even to weak stimuli.  Finally, for FM signals, each interneuron is tuned to a specific frequency within the sweep, as well as to that same frequency in the following echo.   There is specialization for the CF component of the call at this level as well.  The high proportion of neurons responding to the frequency of the acoustic fovea actually increases at this level.\\n\\nAuditory cortex\\n\\nThe auditory cortex in bats is quite large in comparison with other mammals. Various characteristics of sound are processed by different regions of the cortex, each providing different information about the location or movement of a target object.   Most of the existing studies on information processing in the auditory cortex of the bat have been done by Nobuo Suga on the mustached bat, Pteronotus parnellii. This bat\\'s call has both CF tone and FM sweep components.\\n\\nSuga and his colleagues have shown that the cortex contains a series of \"maps\" of auditory information, each of which is organized systematically based on characteristics of sound such as frequency and amplitude. The neurons in these areas respond only to a specific combination of frequency and timing (sound-echo delay), and are known as combination-sensitive neurons.\\n\\nThe systematically organized maps in the auditory cortex respond to various aspects of the echo signal, such as its delay and its velocity.  These regions are composed of \"combination sensitive\" neurons that require at least two specific stimuli to elicit a response.  The neurons vary systematically across the maps, which are organized by acoustic features of the sound and can be two dimensional.  The different features of the call and its echo are used by the bat to determine important characteristics of their prey.  The maps include:\\n\\nFM-FM area:  This region of the cortex contains FM-FM combination-sensitive neurons.  These cells respond only to the combination of two FM sweeps: a call and its echo.  The neurons in the FM-FM region are often referred to as \"delay-tuned,\" since each responds to a specific time delay between the original call and the echo, in order to find the distance from the target object (the range).  Each neuron also shows specificity for one harmonic in the original call and a different harmonic in the echo.  The neurons within the FM-FM area of the cortex of Pteronotus are organized into columns, in which the delay time is constant vertically but increases across the horizontal plane.  The result is that range is encoded by location on the cortex, and increases systematically across the FM-FM area.\\nCF-CF area:  Another kind of combination-sensitive neuron is the CF-CF neuron.  These respond best to the combination of a CF call containing two given frequencies – a call at 30\\xa0kHz (CF1) and one of its additional harmonics around 60 or 90\\xa0kHz (CF2 or CF3) –  and the corresponding echoes.  Thus, within the CF-CF region, the changes in echo frequency caused by the Doppler shift can be compared to the frequency of the original call to calculate the bat\\'s velocity relative to its target object.  As in the FM-FM area, information is encoded by its location within the map-like organization of the region.  The CF-CF area is first split into the distinct CF1-CF2 and CF1-CF3 areas.  Within each area, the CF1 frequency is organized on an axis, perpendicular to the CF2 or CF3 frequency axis.  In the resulting grid, each neuron codes for a certain combination of frequencies that is indicative of a specific velocity\\nDoppler shifted constant frequency (DSCF) area:  This large section of the cortex is a map of the acoustic fovea, organized by frequency and by amplitude.  Neurons in this region respond to CF signals that have been Doppler shifted (in other words, echoes only) and are within the same narrow frequency range to which the acoustic fovea responds.  For Pteronotus, this is around 61\\xa0kHz.  This area is organized into columns, which are arranged radially based on frequency.  Within a column, each neuron responds to a specific combination of frequency and amplitude. Suga\\'s studies have indicated that this brain region is necessary for frequency discrimination.\\n\\nWhales\\n\\nBiosonar is valuable to both toothed whales (suborder Odontoceti), including dolphins, porpoises, river dolphins, killer whales and sperm whales, and baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti), including right, bowhead, pygmy right, and gray whales and rorquals, because they live in an underwater habitat that has favourable acoustic characteristics and where vision is often extremely limited in range due to absorption or turbidity. Odontocetes are generally able to hear sounds at ultrasonic frequencies while mysticetes hear sounds within the infrasonic frequency regime.\\n\\nEvolution\\nCetacean evolution consisted of three main radiations. Throughout the middle and late Eocene periods (49-31.5 million years ago), archaeocetes, primitive toothed Cetacea that arose from terrestrial mammals, were the only known cetaceans. These primitive aquatic mammals did not possess the ability to echolocate, although they did have slightly adapted underwater hearing. The morphology of acoustically isolated ear bones in basilosaurid archaeocetes indicates that this order had directional hearing underwater at low to mid frequencies by the late middle Eocene. However, with the extinction of archaeocetes at the onset of the Oligocene, two new lineages composed a second radiation. These early mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes can be dated back to the middle Oligocene in New Zealand. Based on past phylogenies, it has been found that extant odontocetes are monophyletic; however, echolocation evolved twice, convergently, along the odontocete lineage: once in Xenorophus, an oligocene stem odontocete, and once in the crown odontecetes  Dispersal rates routes of early odontocetes included transoceanic travel to new adaptive zones. The third radiation occurred later in the Neogene, when present dolphins and their relatives evolved to be the most common species in the modern sea.\\n\\nThere are several theories to explain the evolution of echolocation. There are two proposed drives for the hypotheses of cetacean radiation, one biotic and the other abiotic. The first, adaptive radiation, is the result of a rapid divergence into new adaptive zones. This results in diverse, ecologically different clades that are incomparable. Clade Neocete (crown cetacean) evolved from archaeocetes and dispersed across the world\\'s oceans, estuaries, and rivers. These ecological opportunities were the result of abundant dietary resources with low competition for hunting. This hypothesis of lineage diversification, however, can be unconvincing due to a lack of support for rapid speciation early in cetacean history. A second, more abiotic drive is better supported.\\n\\nPhysical restructuring of the oceans has played a role in echolocation radiation. This was a result of global climate change at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary; from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. Tectonic openings created the Southern ocean with a free flowing Antarctic Circumpolar current. These events allowed for a selection regime characterized by the ability to locate and capture prey in turbid river waters, or allow odontocetes to invade and feed at depths below the photic zone. Further studies have found that echolocation below the photic zone could have been a predation adaptation to diel migrating cephalopods. Since its advent, there has been adaptive radiation especially in the family Delphinidae (dolphins) in which echolocation has become extremely derived.\\n\\nFour proteins have been found to play a major role in toothed whale echolocation. Prestin, a motor protein of the outer hair cells of the inner ear of the mammalian cochlea, is associated with hearing sensitivity. It has undergone two clear episodes of accelerated protein evolution in cetaceans. The first episode of acceleration is connected to odontocete divergence, when echolocation first developed, and the second occurs with the increase in echolocation frequency seen in the family Delphinioidae. Tmc1 and Pjvk are also two proteins related to hearing sensitivity: Tmc1 is associated with hair cell development and Pjvk is associated with hair cell function. Adaptations in the protein Tmc1 are related to the evolution of high-frequency hearing and molecular evolution of Tmc1 and Pjvk are indicative of positive selection for echolocation in odontocetes. Cldn14, a member of the tight junction proteins which form barriers between inner ear cells, shows the same evolutionary pattern as Prestin. The two events of protein evolution, for Prestin and Cldn14, occurred at the same times as the tectonic opening of the Drake Passage (34-31 Ma) and Antarctic ice growth at the Middle Miocene climate transition (14 Ma), with the divergence of odontocetes and mysticetes occurring with the former, and the speciation of Delphinioidae with the latter.\\n\\nThe evolution of two cranial structures has been hypothesized to be linked to echolocation. Cranial telescoping developed first in xenorophids, evolving further in stem odontocetes, until the crown odontocetes show full cranial telescoping, with an overlap between the frontal and maxilla bones and a displacement of the external nares posteriorly. Movement of the external nares may have allowed for a larger nasal apparatus and melon for echolocation. This change occurred after the divergence of the neocetes from the basilosaurids. The first shift towards cranial asymmetry occurred in the Early Oligocene, prior to the xenorophids. A xenorophid fossil (Cotylocara macei) has cranial asymmetry, and shows other indicators of echolocation. However, basal xenorophids lack cranial asymmetry, indicating that cranial asymmetry likely evolved twice. Extant odontocetes have asymmetric nasofacial regions; generally, the median plane is shifted to the left and structures on the right are larger. Both cranial telescoping and asymmetry are hypothesized to be associated with the sound production necessary for echolocation.\\n\\nMechanism\\n\\nThirteen species of extant odontocete evolved narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation in four separate, convergent events. These species include the families Kogiidae (pygmy sperm whales) and Phocoenidae (porpoises), as well as some species of the genus Lagenorhynchus, all of Cephalorhynchus, and the La Plata dolphin. NBHF is thought to have evolved as a means of predator evasion; NBHF-producing species are small relative to other odontocetes, making them viable prey to large species such as the orca. However, because three of the groups developed NBHF prior to the emergence of the orca, predation by other, ancient, raptorial odontocetes must have been the driving force for the development of NBHF, not predation by the orca. Orcas, and, presumably, ancient, raptorial odontocetes such as Acrophyseter, are unable to hear frequencies below 100\\xa0kHz.\\n\\nAnother reason for variation in echolocation is habitat. For all sonar systems the limiting factor deciding whether a returning echo is detected is the echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). The ENR is given by the emitted source level (SL) plus the target strength, minus the two-way transmission loss (absorption and spreading) and the received noise. Animals will adapt either to maximize range under noise-limited conditions (increase source level) or to reduce noise clutter in a shallow and/or littered habitat (decrease source level). In cluttered habitats, such as coastal areas, prey ranges are smaller, and species such as Commerson\\'s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) have lowered source levels to better suit their environment.\\n\\nToothed whales emit a focused beam of high-frequency clicks in the direction that their head is pointing. Sounds are generated by passing air from the bony nares through the phonic lips. These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the \\'melon\\'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities. Most toothed whales use clicks in a series, or click train, for echolocation, while the sperm whale may produce clicks individually. Toothed whale whistles do not appear to be used in echolocation. Different rates of click production in a click train give rise to the familiar barks, squeals and growls of the bottlenose dolphin. A click train with a repetition rate over 600 per second is called a burst pulse. In bottlenose dolphins, the auditory brain response resolves individual clicks up to 600 per second, but yields a graded response for higher repetition rates.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that some smaller toothed whales may have their tooth arrangement suited to aid in echolocation.  The placement of teeth in the jaw of a bottlenose dolphin, for example, are not symmetrical when seen from a vertical plane, and this asymmetry could possibly be an aid in the dolphin sensing if echoes from its biosonar are coming from one side or the other. However, this idea lacks experimental support.\\n\\nEchoes are received using complex fatty structures around the lower jaw as the primary reception path, from where they are transmitted to the middle ear via a continuous fat body. Lateral sound may be received through fatty lobes surrounding the ears with a similar density to water. Some researchers believe that when they approach the object of interest, they protect themselves against the louder echo by quietening the emitted sound. In bats this is known to happen, but here the hearing sensitivity is also reduced close to a target.\\n\\nOilbirds and swiftlets\\n\\nOilbirds and some species of swiftlet are known to use a relatively crude form of echolocation compared to that of bats and dolphins. These nocturnal birds emit calls while flying and use the calls to navigate through trees and caves where they live.\\n\\nShrews, tenrecs and rats\\n\\nTerrestrial mammals other than bats known or thought to echolocate include two shrew genera (Sorex and Blarina), the tenrecs of Madagascar and solenodons. These include the wandering shrew (Sorex vagrans), the common or Eurasian shrew (Sorex araneus), and the short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). The nature of shrew sounds unlike those of bats are low amplitude, broadband, multi-harmonic and frequency modulated. They  contain no \\'echolocation clicks\\' with reverberations and would seem to be used for simple, close range spatial orientation. In contrast to bats, shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitat rather than additionally to pinpoint food.\\n\\nThere is evidence that blinded laboratory rats can use echolocation to navigate mazes.\\n\\nEcholocation jamming\\n\\nEcholocation systems are susceptible to interference known as echolocation jamming or sonar jamming. Jamming occurs when non-target sounds interfere with target echoes. Jamming can be purposeful or inadvertent and can be caused by the echolocation system itself, other echolocating animals,  prey, or humans. Echolocating animals have evolved to minimize jamming; however, echolocation avoidance behaviors are not always successful.\\n\\nBackground noise can also interfere with echolocation-based tasks via masking - a mechanism whereby noise interferes with the auditory perception of a signal - and via distraction - a mechanism whereby animals allocate finite attentional resources to noise rather than the signal.\\n\\nAvoidance by prey animals \\nGalleria mellonella exhibits predator avoidance behaviors such as dropping, looping, and freezing when emitters sent out ultrasound waves, indicating that G. mellonella can both detect and differentiate between ultrasound frequencies used by predators or from other members of their species. Members of the Saturniidae moth family, which include giant silk moths, have been observed using their large wings to deflect the ultrasonic signals of microbats.\\n\\nSee also \\n\\nAnimal navigation\\nHuman echolocation\\nMagnetoreception\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading \\n\\n \\n  Provides a variety of findings on signal strength, directionality, discrimination, biology and more.\\n  Shows evidence for the sensory integration of shape information between echolocation and vision, and presents the hypothesis of the existence of the mental representation of an \"echoic image\".\\n\\nExternal links \\nThe DSP Behind Bat Echolocation - analysis of several kinds of bat echolocation\\nInternational Bioacoustics Council - links to many bioacoustics resources\\nBritish Library Sound Archive: Listen to Nature - has bat and swiftlet sonar signals\\nBat Ecology & Bioacoustics Lab\\nUniversity of Maryland Bat Research Lab - website of Dr. Cynthia Moss\\nBatlab at Brown University - JA Simmons Lab website\\nMorcegoteca Program for Biodiversity Research (PPBio)\\n\\nEthology\\nNeuroethology\\nPerception\\nSonar\\nAnimal communication',\n",
       "       'Irruptive growth is a growth pattern over time, defined by a sudden rapid growth in the population of an organism. Irruptive growth is studied in population ecology. Population cycles often display irruptive growth, but with a predictable pattern subsequent decline. It is a phenomenon typically associated with r-strategists. Humans do not show irruptive growth.\\n\\nIrruptive growth occurs when a species reproduces rapidly. It is especially common in large herbivores, such as pronghorn or elk (red deer), which have high fecundity and delayed density-dependent effects on recruitment. All populations show logistic growth, but in species which exhibit irruptive growth this is especially rapid. Populations of some species initially show a lack of response to density-dependent factors that limit population size as it nears the carrying capacity of the environment. The exhibition of irruptive growth is dependent on a number of elements including resource availability, degree of both interspecific and intraspecific competition, and strength of predator-prey relationships. In ecosystems with more than one species feeding on a certain resource, the populations of certain species can irrupt in non-predictable ways depending upon the complex feedback mechanisms caused by competition. A species population may sometimes irrupt when predators are removed, or when favourable weather causes food supplies to rapidly increase.\\n\\nSimilar to white-tailed deer in North America, roe deer in Europe have shown similar fecundity even as the population density doubles three or four times. The deer are able to irrupt because the species is able to double its population yearly and populations show delayed response to density-dependent factors, in other words -the females remain just as fertile despite having lower body weights and other characteristics affiliated with overpopulation.\\n\\nIrruptive growth patterns are also seen in mammal herbivores with a relatively small body size, or such creatures in Arctic ecosystems which are subject to population cycles. In cases where a single herbivore prey species is dominant in an ecosystem, there is likely to be a strong link with predator species which serves to control the population (see Lotka–Volterra equations). The populations of rabbits and house mice introduced Australia show irruptive growth, for example. A possible reason may be that after drought ends, they reproduce at a rapid rate while predator reproduction is still seasonal in occurrence. This allows for the population to explode and to be limited more by a return of dry conditions than by predators. Invasive species which can reproduce rapidly may show this pattern of growth because when a new area is being colonized predator species are often not present to limit growth, and there is little intraspecific and/or interspecific competition in early settlement of a location which means there is abundant resource availability.\\n\\nK-strategist and r-strategist species\\n\\nSpecies that are r-strategist (species that evolve according to r-selection) are characterized by rapid development, early reproduction, small body size, and shorter lifespans, whereas K-strategist species (species that evolve according to K-selection) exhibit slow development, delayed reproduction, large body size, and longer lifespans.\\n\\nSpecies that are r-strategist are more likely to exhibit irruptive growth than K-strategist species. r-selection leads to high productivity, while K-selection leads to high efficiency. Productivity refers to the number of offspring produced, whereas efficiency refers to the probability of survival of individual offspring.\\n\\nThe human species is K-strategist; that is, each mating pair has a small number of offspring, of which the majority will survive to adulthood and reach reproductive age. r-strategist species, such as some insects and most plants, have very large numbers of offspring, the majority of which will die before reaching physical maturity. If there is a change in their environment, more of these offspring may survive than is typical, leading to irruptive growth. Because K-strategist species have less offspring they are less likely to exhibit irruptive growth.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nPopulation ecology',\n",

       "       'In biology, metamerism is the phenomenon of having a linear series of body segments fundamentally similar in structure, though not all such structures are entirely alike in any single life form because some of them perform special functions.\\nIn animals, metameric segments are referred to as somites or metameres. In plants, they are referred to as metamers or, more concretely, phytomers.\\n\\nIn animals\\n\\nIn animals, zoologists define metamery as a mesodermal event resulting in serial repetition of unit subdivisions of ectoderm and mesoderm products. Endoderm is not involved in metamery.  Segmentation is not the same concept as metamerism: segmentation can be confined only to ectodermally derived tissue, e.g., in the Cestoda tapeworms. Metamerism is far more important biologically since it results in metameres - also called somites - that play a critical role in advanced locomotion.\\n\\nOne can divide metamerism into two main categories: \\n homonomous metamery is a strict serial succession of metameres. It can be grouped into two more classifications known as pseudometamerism and true metamerism. An example of pseudometamerism is in the class Cestoda. The tapeworm is composed of many repeating segments - primarily for reproduction and basic nutrient exchange. Each segment acts independently from the others, which is why it is not considered true metamerism. Another worm, the earthworm in phylum Annelida, can exemplify true metamerism. In each segment of the worm, a repetition of organs and muscle tissue can be found. What differentiates the Annelids from Cestoda is that the segments in the earthworm all work together for the whole organism. It is believed that segmentation evolved for many reasons, including a higher degree of motion. Taking the earthworm, for example: the segmentation of the muscular tissue allows the worm to move in an inching pattern. The circular muscles work to allow the segments to elongate one by one, and the longitudinal muscles then work to shorten the elongated segments. This pattern continues down the entirety of the worm, allowing it to inch along a surface. Each segment is allowed to work independently, but towards the movement of the whole worm.   \\n heteronomous metamery is the condition where metameres have grouped together to perform similar tasks. The extreme example of this is the insect head (5 metameres), thorax (3 metameres), and abdomen (11 metameres, not all discernible in all insects). The process that results in the grouping of metameres is called \"tagmatization\", and each grouping is called a tagma (plural: tagmata). In organisms with highly derived tagmata, such as the insects, much of the metamerism within a tagma may not be trivially distinguishable. It may have to be sought in structures that do not necessarily reflect the grouped metameric function (eg. the  ladder nerve system or somites do not reflect the unitary structure of a thorax).\\n\\nIn addition, an animal may be classified as \"pseudometameric\", meaning that it has clear internal metamerism but no corresponding external metamerism - as is seen, for example, in Monoplacophora.\\n\\nHumans and other chordates are conspicuous examples of organisms that have metameres intimately grouped into tagmata. In the Chordata the metameres of each tagma are fused to such an extent that few repetitive features are directly visible. Intensive investigation is necessary to discern the metamerism in the tagmata of such organisms. Examples of detectable evidence of  vestigially metameric structures include branchial arches and cranial nerves.\\n\\nSome schemes regard the concept of metamerism as one of the four principles of construction of the human body, common to many animals, along with general bilateral symmetry (or zygomorphism), pachymerism (or tubulation), and  stratification. More recent schemes also include three other concepts: segmentation (conceived as different from metamerism),  polarity and endocrinosity.\\n\\nIn plants\\nA metamer is one of several segments that share in the construction of a shoot, or into which a shoot may be conceptually (at least) resolved. In the metameristic model, a plant consists of a series of \\'phytons\\' or phytomers, each consisting of an internode and its upper node with the attached leaf. As Asa Gray (1850) wrote:\\n\\nThe branch, or simple stem itself, is manifestly an assemblage of similar parts, placed one above another in a continuous series, developed one from another in successive generations. Each one of these joints of stem, bearing its leaf at the apex, is a plant element; or as we term it a phyton,—a potential plant, having all the organs of vegetation, namely, stem, leaf, and in its downward development even a root, or its equivalent. This view of the composition of the plant, though by no means a new one, has not been duly appreciated. I deem it essential to a correct philosophical understanding of the plant.\\n\\nSome plants, particularly grasses, demonstrate a rather clear metameric construction, but many others either lack discrete modules or their presence is more arguable. Phyton theory has been criticized as an over-ingenious, academic conception which bears little relation to reality. Eames (1961) concluded that \"concepts of the shoot as consisting of a series of structural units have been obscured by the dominance of the stem- and leaf-theory. Anatomical units like these do not exist: the shoot is the basic unit.\"  Even so, others still consider comparative study along the length of the metameric organism to be a fundamental aspect of plant morphology.\\n\\nMetameric conceptions generally segment the vegetative axis into repeating units along its length, but constructs based on other divisions are possible. The pipe model theory conceives of the plant (especially trees) as made up of unit pipes (\\'metamers\\'), each supporting a unit amount of photosynthetic tissue.  Vertical metamers are also suggested in some desert shrubs in which the stem is modified into isolated strips of xylem, each having continuity from root to shoot. This may enable the plant to abscise a large part of its shoot system in response to drought, without damaging the remaining part.\\n\\nIn vascular plants, the shoot system differs fundamentally from the root system in that the former shows a metameric construction (repeated units of organs; stem, leaf, and inflorescence), while the latter does not. The plant embryo represents the first metamer of the shoot in spermatophytes or seed plants.\\n\\nPlants (especially trees) are considered to have a \\'modular construction,\\' a module  being an axis in which the entire sequence of aerial differentiation is carried out from the initiation of the meristem to the onset of sexuality (e.g. flower or cone development) which completes its development. These modules are considered to be developmental units, not necessarily structural.\\n\\nSee also \\n\\n Metamerism (disambiguation) (for other meanings)\\n Segmentation\\n Phytomer\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nDevelopmental biology\\nBiology articles needing attention\\nZoology',\n",
       "       'Microbats constitute the suborder Microchiroptera within the order Chiroptera (bats). Bats have long been differentiated into Megachiroptera (megabats) and Microchiroptera, based on their size, the use of echolocation by the Microchiroptera and other features; molecular evidence suggests a somewhat different subdivision, as the microbats have been shown to be a paraphyletic group.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nMicrobats are  long. Most microbats feed on insects, but some of the larger species hunt birds, lizards, frogs, smaller bats or even fish. Only three species of microbat feed on the blood of large mammals or birds (\"vampire bats\"); these bats live in South and Central America.\\n\\nAlthough most \"Leaf-nose\" microbats are fruit and nectar-eating, the name “leaf-nosed” isn\\'t a designation meant to indicate the preferred diet among said variety. Three species follow the bloom of columnar cacti in northwest Mexico and the Southwest United States northward in the northern spring and then the blooming agaves southward in the northern fall (autumn). Other leaf-nosed bats, such as Vampyrum spectrum of South America, hunt a variety of prey such as lizards and birds. The horseshoe bats of Europe, as well as California leaf-nosed bats, have a very intricate leaf-nose for echolocation, and feed primarily on insects.\\n\\nDifferences from megabats \\n Microbats use echolocation, whereas megabats do not typically. (The Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus egyptiacus is an exception, but does not use the larynx echolocation method of microbats, instead giving scientists the theory that it clicks using its nasal passages and back of its tongue.)\\n Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. This finger appears thinner and almost bonded by tissue with the third finger for extra support during flight.\\n Megabats lack tails, with the exception of a few genera such as Nyctimene, whereas this trait only occurs in certain species of microbats.\\n The ears of microbats possess a tragus (thought to be crucial in echolocation) and are relatively larger than megabat ears, whereas megabat ears are comparatively small and lack a tragus.\\n Megabat eyes are quite large, whereas microbat eyes are comparatively smaller.\\n\\nDentition \\n\\nThe form and function of microbat teeth differ as a result of the various diets these bats can have. Teeth are primarily designed to break down food; therefore, the shape of the teeth correlate to specific feeding behaviors. In comparison to megabats which feed only on fruit and nectar, microbats illustrate a range of diets and have been classified as insectivores, carnivores, sanguinivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Differences seen between the size and function of the canines and molars among microbats in these groups vary as a result of this. \\n\\nThe diverse diets of microbats reflect having dentition, or cheek teeth, that display a morphology derived from dilambdodont teeth, which are characterized by a W-shaped ectoloph, or stylar shelf. A W-shaped dilambdodont upper molar includes a metacone and paracone, which are located at the bottom of the “W”; while the rest of the “W” is formed by crests that run from the metacone and paracone to the cusps of the stylar self.\\n\\nMicrobats display differences between the size and shape of their canines and molars, in addition to having distinctive variations among their skull features that contribute to their ability to feed effectively. Frugivorous microbats have small stylar shelf areas, short molariform rows, and wide palates and faces. In addition to having wide faces, frugivorous microbats have short skulls, which place the teeth closer to the fulcrum of the jaw lever, allowing an increase in jaw strength. Frugivorous microbats also possess a different pattern on their molars compared to carnivorous, insectivorous, nectarivorous, and sanguinivorous microbats. In contrast, insectivorous microbats are characterized by having larger, but fewer teeth, long canines, and shortened third upper molars; while carnivorous microbats have large upper molars. Generally, microbats that are insectivores, carnivores, and frugivores have large teeth and small palates; however, the opposite is true for microbats that are nectarivores. Though differences exist between the palate and teeth sizes of microbats, the proportion of the sizes of these two structures are maintained among microbats of various sizes.\\n\\nEcholocation \\n\\nEcholocation is the process where an animal produces a sound of certain wavelength, and then listens to and compares the reflected echoes to the original sound emitted. Bats use echolocation to form images of their surrounding environment and the organisms that inhabit it by eliciting ultrasonic waves via their larynx. The difference between the ultrasonic waves produced by the bat and what the bat hears provides the bat with information about its environment. Echolocation aids the bat in not only detecting prey, but also in orientation during flight.\\n\\nProduction of ultrasonic waves \\nMost microbats generate ultrasound with their larynx and emit the sound through their nose or mouth. Sound productions are generated from the vocal folds in mammals due to the elastic membranes that compose these folds. Vocalization requires these elastic membranes because they act as a source to transform airflow into acoustic pressure waves. Energy is supplied to the elastic membranes from the lungs, and results in the production of sound. The larynx houses the vocal cords and forms the passageway for the expiratory air that will produce sound. Microbat  range in frequency from 14,000 to over 100,000 hertz, well beyond the range of the human ear (typical human hearing range is considered to be from 20 to 20,000\\xa0Hz). The emitted vocalizations form a broad beam of sound used to probe the environment, as well as communicate with other bats.\\n\\nLaryngeally echolocating microbats \\n\\nLaryngeal echolocation is the dominant form of echolocation in microbats, however, it is not the only way in which microbats can produce ultrasonic waves. Excluding non-echolocating and laryngeally echolocating microbats, other species of microbats and megabats have been shown to produce ultrasonic waves by clapping their wings, clicking their tongues, or using their nose. Laryngeally echolocating bats, in general, produce ultrasonic waves with their larynx that is specialized to produce sounds of short wavelength. The larynx is located at the cranial end of the trachea and is surrounded by cricothyroid muscles and thyroid cartilage. For reference, in humans, this is the area where the Adam\\'s apple is located. Phonation of ultrasonic waves is produced through the vibrations of the vocal membranes in the expiratory air. The intensity that these vocal folds vibrate at varies with activity and between bat species. A characteristic of laryngeally echolocating microbats that distinguishes them from other echolocating microbats is the articulation of their stylohyal bone with their tympanic bone. The stylohyal bones are part of the hyoid apparatus that help support the throat and larynx. The tympanic bone forms the floor of the middle ear. In addition to the connection between the stylohyal bone and the tympanic bone as being an indicator of laryngeally echolocating microbats, another definitive marker is the presence of a flattened and expanded stylohyal bone at the cranial end. Microbats that laryngeally echolocate must be able to distinguish between the differences of the pulse that they produce and the returning echo that follows by being able to process and understand the ultrasonic waves at a neuronal level, in order to accurately obtain information about their surrounding environment and orientation in it. The connection between the stylohyal bone and the tympanic bone enables the bat to neurally register the outgoing and incoming ultrasonic waves produced by the larynx. Furthermore, the stylohyal bones connect the larynx to the tympanic bones via a cartilaginous or fibrous connection (depending on the species of bat). Mechanically the importance of this connection is that it supports the larynx by anchoring it to the surrounding cricothryroid muscles, as well as draws it closer to the nasal cavity during phonation. The stylohyal bones are often reduced in many other mammals, however, they are more prominent in laryngeally echolocating bats and are part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus. The hyoid apparatus functions in breathing, swallowing, and phonation in microbats as well as other mammals. An important feature of the bony connection in laryngeally echolocating microbats is the extended articulation of the ventral portion of the tympanic bones and the proximal end of the stylohyal bone that bends around it to make this connection.\\n\\nOther \\nThe human vocalization system has been extensively studied, and as a result, is the most well understood compared to any other mammal. It has been instrumental in increasing our understanding of the vocalization systems of other mammals, including microbats. In the past, the human vocalization system was believed to be unique when compared to any of the other mammal vocalization systems, because of its ability to produce complex language and song. However, data has demonstrated that the human vocalization system is relatively similar to other mammal vocalization systems. A common theme that has been identified in all tetrapods, including humans and microbats: (1) a respiratory system with lungs; (2) a vocal tract that filters emitted sound before it exits into the surrounding environment; and (3) every tetrapod has a larynx that quickly closes to function in protection of the lungs, as well as it often might function in phonation, as is the case in humans and microbats. One feature of the mammal vocalization system that results in variation of sound production, especially for microbats and megabats, is the length of vocal folds. The vocal folds determine the lowest frequency at which the folds can vibrate. Compared to humans, the length of vocal folds in microbats is very short. This allows them to generate their characteristic ultrasonic waves that are above the human hearing range. In contrast, vocal folds of larger mammals, such as whales are greatly hypertrophied, which results in the production of infrasonic sounds far below the human hearing range.\\n\\nSome moths have developed a protection against bats. They are able to hear bats\\' ultrasounds and flee as soon as they notice these sounds, or stop beating their wings for some time to deprive the bats of the characteristic echo signature of moving wings on which they may home in. To counteract this, the bats may cease producing the ultrasound bursts as they near prey, and thus avoid detection.\\n\\nClassification \\n\\nWhile bats have been traditionally divided into megabats and microbats, recent molecular evidence has shown  the superfamily Rhinolophoidea to be more genetically related to megabats than to microbats, indicating the microbats are paraphyletic.  To resolve the paraphyly of microbats, the Chiroptera were redivided into suborders Yangochiroptera (which includes Nycteridae, vespertilionoids, noctilionoids, and emballonuroids) and Yinpterochiroptera, which includes megabats, rhinopomatids, Rhinolophidae, and Megadermatidae.\\n\\nThis is the classification according to Simmons and Geisler (1998):\\n\\nSuperfamily Emballonuroidea\\n Family Emballonuridae (sac-winged bats or sheath-tailed bats)\\nSuperfamily Rhinopomatoidea\\n Family Rhinopomatidae (mouse-tailed bats)\\n Family Craseonycteridae (bumblebee bat or Kitti\\'s hog-nosed bat)\\nSuperfamily Rhinolophoidea\\n Family Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats)\\n Family Nycteridae (hollow-faced bats or slit-faced bats)\\n Family Megadermatidae (false vampires)\\nSuperfamily Vespertilionoidea\\n Family Vespertilionidae (vesper bats or evening bats)\\nSuperfamily Molossoidea\\n Family Molossidae (free-tailed bats)\\n Family Antrozoidae (pallid bats)\\nSuperfamily Nataloidea\\n Family Natalidae (funnel-eared bats)\\n Family Myzopodidae (sucker-footed bats)\\n Family Thyropteridae (disk-winged bats)\\n Family Furipteridae (smoky bats)\\nSuperfamily Noctilionoidea\\n Family Noctilionidae (bulldog bats or fisherman bats)\\n Family Mystacinidae (New Zealand short-tailed bats)\\n Family Mormoopidae (ghost-faced bats or moustached bats)\\n Family Phyllostomidae (leaf-nosed bats)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\nBat World Sanctuary\\nIllustrated Identification key to the bats of Europe  (see \"Recent publications\")\\nBat Conservation International\\n \\n\\nBat taxonomy\\nAnimals that use echolocation\\nParaphyletic groups',\n",
       "       'Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish (i.e. fishing) from a body of water at a rate greater than that the species can replenish its population naturally (i.e. the overexploitation of the fishery\\'s existing fish stock), resulting in the species becoming increasingly underpopulated in that area. Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in resource depletion, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels. Sustained overfishing can lead to critical depensation, where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms of overfishing, such as the overfishing of sharks, has led to the upset of entire marine ecosystems. Types of overfishing include: growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, ecosystem overfishing.\\n\\nThe ability of a fishery to recover from overfishing depends on whether its overall carrying capacity and the variety of ecological conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might exploit the change in competitive equilibria and take over in a way that makes it impossible for the trout to re-establish a breeding population.\\n\\nSince the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in bottom dragging is devastating to coral, sponges and other slower-growing benthic species that do not recover quickly, and that provide a habitat for commercial fisheries species. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species\\' composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the collateral capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.\\n\\nA report by FAO in 2020 stated that \"in 2017, 34 percent of the fish stocks of the world’s marine fisheries were classified as overfished\". Mitigation options include: Government regulation, removal of subsidies, minimizing fishing impact, aquaculture and consumer awareness.\\n\\nScale \\n\\nOverfishing has stripped many fisheries around the world of their stocks. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing. Significant overfishing has been observed in pre-industrial times. In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from the earliest days of European colonisation of the Americas has been well documented.\\n\\nThe fraction of fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited a decreasing trend, from 90% in 1974 to 66.9% in 2015. In contrast, the percentage of stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels increased from 10% in 1974 to 33.1% in 2015, with the largest increases in the late-1970s and 1980s. \\n\\nIn 2015, maximally sustainably fished stocks (formerly termed fully fished stocks) accounted for 59.9% and underfished stocks for 7% of the total assessed stocks. While the proportion of underfished stocks decreased continuously from 1974 to 2015, the maximally sustainably fished stocks decreased from 1974 to 1989, and then increased to 59.9% in 2015.\\n\\nIn 2015, among the 16 major statistical areas, the Mediterranean and Black Sea had the highest percentage (62.2%) of unsustainable stocks, closely followed by the Southeast Pacific 61.5% and Southwest Atlantic 58.8%. In contrast, the Eastern Central Pacific, Northeast Pacific (Area 67), Northwest Pacific (Area 61), Western Central Pacific and Southwest Pacific had the lowest proportion (13 to 17%) of fish stocks at biologically unsustainable levels.\\n\\nDaniel Pauly, a fisheries scientist known for pioneering work on the human impacts on global fisheries, has commented:\\n\\nAccording to the Secretary General of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, \"Overfishing cannot continue, the depletion of fisheries poses a major threat to the food supply of millions of people.\"\\n\\nThe fishing down the food web is something that occurs when overfishing arises. Once all larger fish are caught, the fisherman will start to fish the smaller individuals, which would lead to more fish needing to be caught to keep up with demand. This decreases fish populations, as well as genetic diversity of the species, making them more susceptible to disease, and less likely to adapt to their stressors and the environment. Additionally, catching smaller fish leads to breeding of smaller offspring, which can be problematic for fish. In many species, the smaller the female, the less fecund it is, impacting the fish population.\\n\\nExamples and evidence for overfishing\\nExamples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea. In these locations, overfishing has not only proved disastrous to fish stocks, but also to the fishing communities relying on the harvest. Like other extractive industries such as forestry and hunting, fisheries are susceptible to economic interaction between ownership or stewardship and sustainability, otherwise known as the tragedy of the commons.\\n\\n Tuna has been caught by the locals in the upper Adriatic for centuries. Increasing fishing prevented the large schools of little tunny from migrating into the Gulf of Trieste. The last major tuna catch was made in 1954 by the fishermen of Santa Croce, Contovello and Barcola.\\n The Peruvian coastal anchovy fisheries crashed in the 1970s after overfishing and an El Niño season largely depleted anchovies from its waters. Anchovies were a major natural resource in Peru; indeed, 1971 alone yielded 10.2 million metric tons of anchovies. However, the following five years saw the Peruvian fleet\\'s catch amount to only about four million tons. This was a major loss to Peru\\'s economy.\\n\\n The collapse of the cod fishery off Newfoundland, and the 1992 decision by Canada to impose an indefinite moratorium on the Grand Banks, is a dramatic example of the consequences of overfishing.\\n The sole fisheries in the Irish Sea, the west English Channel, and other locations have become overfished to the point of virtual collapse, according to the UK government\\'s official Biodiversity Action Plan. The United Kingdom has created elements in this plan to attempt to restore the fishery, but the expanding global human population and the expanding demand for fish has reached a point where demand for food threatens the stability of these fisheries, if not the species\\' survival.\\n Many deep sea fish are at risk, such as orange roughy and sablefish. The deep sea is almost completely dark, near freezing, and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many do not reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy at the store is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, where there are no legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate for food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.\\n Blue walleye became extinct in the Great Lakes in the 1980s. Until the middle of the 20th century, the walleye was a commercially valuable fish, with about a half million tonnes being landed in the period from about 1880 to the late-1950s, when the populations collapsed, apparently through a combination of overfishing, anthropogenic eutrophication, and competition with introduced rainbow smelt.\\n The World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London jointly issued their \"Living Blue Planet Report\" on 16 September 2015 which states that there was a dramatic fall of 74% in worldwide stocks of the important scombridae fish such as mackerel, tuna and bonitos between 1970 and 2010, and the global overall \"population sizes of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish fell by half on average in just 40 years.\"\\n Overfishing of the critically endangered Pacific bluefin tuna has resulted in the few still caught selling for astronomical prices. In January 2019, a 278 kilogram (612 pound) tuna sold for 333.6 million yen, or over US$3 million, US$4,900 per pound. Fishers, driven by the fish\\'s high value, use extraordinary techniques to catch them, leaving the population on the verge of collapse.\\nSharks and rays: The global abundance of oceanic sharks and rays has declined by 71% since 1970, owing to an 18-fold increase in relative fishing pressure. As a consequence, three-quarters of the species comprising this group are now threatened with extinction.\\nA study in 2003 found that, as compared with 1950 levels, only a remnant (in some instances, as little as 10%) of all large ocean-fish stocks are left in the seas. These large ocean fish are the species at the top of the food chains (e.g., tuna, cod, among others). This article was subsequently criticized as being fundamentally flawed, although much debate still exists and the majority of fisheries scientists now consider the results irrelevant with respect to large pelagics (the open seas).\\n\\nIn management\\nSeveral countries are now effectively managing their fisheries. Examples include Iceland and New Zealand. The United States has turned many of its fisheries around from being in a highly depleted state.\\n\\nConsequences\\n\\nAccording to a 2008 UN report, the world\\'s fishing fleets are losing US$50 billion each year due to depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), asserts that half the world\\'s fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch. In addition, the biomass of global fish stocks have been allowed to run down to the point where it is no longer possible to catch the amount of fish that could be caught. Increased incidence of schistosomiasis in Africa has been linked to declines of fish species that eat the snails carrying the disease-causing parasites. Massive growth of jellyfish populations threaten fish stocks, as they compete with fish for food, eat fish eggs, and poison or swarm fish, and can survive in oxygen depleted environments where fish cannot; they wreak massive havoc on commercial fisheries. Overfishing eliminates a major jellyfish competitor and predator, exacerbating the jellyfish population explosion. Both climate change and a restructuring of the ecosystem have been found to be major roles in an increase in jellyfish population in the Irish Sea in the 1990s.\\n\\nAccording to the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, overfishing is a primary driver of mass extinction in the world\\'s oceans. A 2021 study published in the journal Nature asserted that the \"primary cause\" of ocean defaunation is overfishing. Other studies have shown that overfishing has reduced fish and marine mammal biomass by 60% since the 1800s, and is currently driving over one-third of sharks and rays to extinction.\\n\\nTypes\\nThere are three recognized types of biological overfishing: growth overfishing, recruit overfishing, and ecosystem overfishing.\\n\\nGrowth overfishing\\n\\nGrowth overfishing occurs when fish are harvested at an average size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less than it would be if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.\\n\\nRecruitment overfishing\\nRecruitment overfishing happens when the mature adult population (spawning biomass) is depleted to a level where it no longer has the reproductive capacity to replenish itselfthere are not enough adults to produce offspring. Increasing the spawning stock biomass to a target level is the approach taken by managers to restore an overfished population to sustainable levels. This is generally accomplished by placing moratoriums, quotas, and minimum size limits on a fish population.\\n\\nEcosystem overfishing\\nEcosystem overfishing occurs when the balance of the ecosystem is altered by overfishing. With declines in the abundance of large predatory species, the abundance of small forage type increases causing a shift in the balance of the ecosystem towards smaller fish species.\\n\\nAcceptable levels\\nThe notion of overfishing hinges on what is meant by an \"acceptable level\" of fishing. More precise biological and bioeconomic terms define acceptable level as follows:\\n\\n Biological overfishing occurs when fishing mortality has reached a level where the stock biomass has negative marginal growth (reduced rate of biomass growth), as indicated by the red area in the figure. (Fish are being taken out of the water so quickly that the replenishment of stock by breeding slows down. If the replenishment continues to diminish for long enough, replenishment will go into reverse and the population will decrease.)\\n Economic or bioeconomic overfishing additionally considers the cost of fishing when determining acceptable catches. Under this framework, a fishery is considered to be overfished when catches exceed maximum economic yield where resource rent is at its maximum. Fish are being removed from the fishery so quickly that the profitability of the fishery is sub-optimal. A more dynamic definition of economic overfishing also considers the present value of the fishery using a relevant discount rate to maximise the flow of resource rent over all future catches.\\n\\nHarvest control rule\\nA model proposed in 2010 for predicting acceptable levels of fishing is the Harvest Control Rule (HCR), which is a set of tools and protocols with which management has some direct control of harvest rates and strategies in relation to predicting stock status, and long-term maximum sustainable yields. Constant catch and constant fishing mortality are two types of simple harvest control rules.\\n\\nInput and output orientations\\nFishing capacity can also be defined using an input or output orientation.\\n\\n An input-oriented fishing capacity is defined as the maximum available capital stock in a fishery that is fully utilized at the maximum technical efficiency in a given time period, given resource and market conditions.\\n\\n An output-oriented fishing capacity is defined as the maximum catch a vessel (fleet) can produce if inputs are fully utilized given the biomass, the fixed inputs, the age structure of the fish stock, and the present stage of technology.\\n\\nTechnical efficiency of each vessel of the fleet is assumed necessary to attain this maximum catch. The degree of capacity utilization results from the comparison of the actual level of output (input) and the capacity output (input) of a vessel or a fleet.\\n\\nMitigation\\nIn order to meet the problems of overfishing, a precautionary approach and Harvest Control Rule (HCR) management principles have been introduced in the main fisheries around the world. The Traffic Light color convention introduces sets of rules based on predefined critical values, which can be adjusted as more information is gained.\\n\\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles 61, 62, and 65.\\nArticle 61 requires all coastal states to ensure that the maintenance of living resources in their exclusive economic zones is not endangered by over-exploitation. The same article addresses the maintenance or restoration of populations of species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.\\nArticle 62 provides that coastal states: \"shall promote the objective of optimum utilization of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone without prejudice to Article 61\"\\nArticle 65 provides generally for the rights of, inter alia, coastal states to prohibit, limit, or regulate the exploitation of marine mammals.\\n\\nAccording to some observers, overfishing can be viewed as an example of the tragedy of the commons; appropriate solutions would therefore promote property rights through, for instance, privatization and fish farming. Daniel K. Benjamin, in Fisheries are Classic Example of the \\'Tragedy of the Commons\\'\\'\\', cites research by Grafton, Squires and Fox to support the idea that privatization can solve the overfishing problem: According to recent research on the British Columbia halibut fishery, where the commons has been at least partly privatized, substantial ecological and economic benefits have resulted. There is less damage to fish stocks, the fishing is safer, and fewer resources are needed to achieve a given harvest.\"\\n\\nAnother possible solution, at least for some areas, is quotas, restricting fishers to a specific quantity of fish. A more radical possibility is declaring certain areas of the sea \"no-go zones\" and make fishing there strictly illegal, so the fish have time to recover and repopulate.\\n\\nIn order to maximise resources some countries, e.g., Bangladesh and Thailand, have improved the availability of family planning services. The resulting smaller populations have a decreased environmental footprint and reduced food needs.\\n\\nControlling consumer behavior and demand is critical in mitigating action. Worldwide, a number of initiatives emerged to provide consumers with information regarding the conservation status of the seafood available to them. The \"Guide to Good Fish Guides\" lists a number of these.\\n\\nGovernment regulation\\n\\nMany regulatory measures are available for controlling overfishing. These measures include fishing quotas, bag limits, licensing, closed seasons, size limits and the creation of marine reserves and other marine protected areas.\\n\\nA model of the interaction between fish and fishers showed that when an area is closed to fishers, but there are no catch regulations such as individual transferable quotas, fish catches are temporarily increased but overall fish biomass is reduced, resulting in the opposite outcome from the one desired for fisheries. Thus, a displacement of the fleet from one locality to another will generally have little effect if the same quota is taken. As a result, management measures such as temporary closures or establishing a marine protected area of fishing areas are ineffective when not combined with individual fishing quotas. An inherent problem with quotas is that fish populations vary from year to year. A study has found that fish populations rise dramatically after stormy years due to more nutrients reaching the surface and therefore greater primary production. To fish sustainably, quotas need to be changed each year to account for fish population.\\n\\nIndividual transferable quotas (ITQs) are fishery rationalization instruments defined under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish. Fisheries scientists decide the optimal amount of fish (total allowable catch) to be harvested in a certain fishery. The decision considers carrying capacity, regeneration rates and future values. Under ITQs, members of a fishery are granted rights to a percentage of the total allowable catch that can be harvested each year. These quotas can be fished, bought, sold, or leased allowing for the least-cost vessels to be used. ITQs are used in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Canada, and the United States.\\n\\nIn 2008, a large-scale study of fisheries that used ITQs compared to ones that didn\\'t provided strong evidence that ITQs can help to prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.\\n\\nChina bans fishing in the South China Sea for a period each year.\\n\\nThe United Nations has included sustainable fishing and ending subsidies that contribute to overfishing as key targets for 2030 as part of their Sustainable Development Goal 14:  Life Below Water.\\n\\nRemoval of subsidies\\n\\nBecause government provided financial subsidies can make it economically viable to fish beyond biologically sustainable levels, several scientists have called for an end to fishery subsidies paid to deep-sea fisheries. In international waters beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones of coastal countries, many fisheries are unregulated, and fishing fleets plunder the depths with state-of-the-art technology. In a few hours, massive nets weighing up to 15 tons, dragged along the bottom by deep-water trawlers, can destroy deep-sea corals and sponge beds that have taken centuries or millennia to grow. The trawlers can target orange roughy, grenadiers, or sharks. These fish are usually long-lived and late maturing, and their populations take decades, even centuries to recover.\\n\\nFisheries scientist Daniel Pauly and economist Ussif Rashid Sumaila have examined subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets around the world. They found that US$152 million per year are paid to deep-sea fisheries. Without these subsidies, global deep-sea fisheries would operate at a loss of US$50 million a year. A great deal of the subsidies paid to deep-sea trawlers is to subsidize the large amount of fuel required to travel beyond the 200 mile limit and drag weighted nets.\\n\"There is surely a better way for governments to spend money than by paying subsidies to a fleet that burns 1.1 billion litres of fuel annually to maintain paltry catches of old growth fish from highly vulnerable stocks, while destroying their habitat in the process\" – Pauly.\\n\\n\"Eliminating global subsidies would render these fleets economically unviable and would relieve tremendous pressure on over-fishing and vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems\" – Sumaila.Over 30 billion euros in public subsidies are directed to fisheries annually.\\n\\nMinimizing fishing impact\\nFishing techniques may be altered to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied gear types depending on target species and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture. A turtle excluder device (TED) allows sea turtles and other megafauna to escape from shrimp trawls. Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.\\n\\nAquaculture\\nAquaculture involves the farming of fish in captivity. This approach effectively privatizes fish stocks and creates incentives for farmers to conserve their stocks. It also reduces environmental impact. However, farming carnivorous fish, such as salmon, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries, since carnivorous farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish.  The various species of Pacific salmon and Atlantic salmon are relatively easy to raise in captivity and such aquacultural operations have existed for more than 150 years.  Largescale releases of salmon raised in captivity to supplement wild salmon runs will usually increase fishing pressure on the much less abundant wild salmon runs.\\n\\nAquaculture played a minor role in the harvesting of marine organisms until the 1970s. Growth in aquaculture increased rapidly in the 1990s when the rate of wild capture plateaued. Aquaculture now provides approximately half of all harvested aquatic organisms. Aquaculture production rates continue to grow while wild harvest remains steady.\\n\\nFish farming can enclose the entire breeding cycle of the fish, with fish being bred in captivity. Some fish prove difficult to breed in captivity and can be caught in the wild as juveniles and brought into captivity to increase their weight. With scientific progress, more species are being made to breed in captivity. This was the case with southern bluefin tuna, which were first bred in captivity in 2009.\\n\\nConsumer awareness\\n\\nAs global citizens become more aware of overfishing and the ecological destruction of the oceans, movements have sprung up to encourage abstinence—not eating any seafood—or eating only \"sustainable seafood\".\\n\\nSustainable seafood is a movement that has gained momentum as more people become aware of overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods. Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. In general, slow-growing fish that reproduce late in life, such as orange roughy, are vulnerable to overfishing. Seafood species that grow quickly and breed young, such as anchovies and sardines, are much more resistant to overfishing. Several organizations, including the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and Friend of the Sea, certify seafood fisheries as sustainable.\\n\\nThe Marine Stewardship Council has developed an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries. Environmentally responsible fisheries management and practices are rewarded with the use of its blue product ecolabel. Consumers concerned about overfishing and its consequences are increasingly able to choose seafood products that have been independently assessed against the MSC\\'s environmental standard. This enables consumers to play a part in reversing the decline of fish stocks. As of February 2012, over 100 fisheries around the world have been independently assessed and certified as meeting the MSC standard. Their where-to-buy page lists the currently available certified seafood. As of February 2012, over 13,000 MSC-labelled products are available in 74 countries around the world. Fish & Kids is an MSC project to teach schoolchildren about marine environmental issues, including overfishing.\\n\\nThe Monterey Bay Aquarium\\'s Seafood Watch Program, although not an official certifying body like the MSC, also provides guidance on the sustainability of certain fish species. Some seafood restaurants have begun to offer more sustainable seafood options. The Seafood Choices Alliance is an organization whose members include chefs that serve sustainable seafood at their establishments. In the US, the Sustainable Fisheries Act defines sustainable practices through national standards. Although there is no official certifying body like the MSC, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has created FishWatch to help guide concerned consumers to sustainable seafood choices.\\n\\nIn September 2016, a partnership of Google and Oceana and Skytruth introduced Global Fishing Watch, a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities.Oceana Unveils Global Fishing Watch—Huffington Post (15 September 2016)\\n\\nBarriers to effective management\\nThe fishing industry has a strong financial incentive to oppose some measures aimed at improving the sustainability of fish stocks. Recreational fisherman also has an interest in maintaining access to fish stocks. This leads to extensive lobbying that can block or weaken government policies intended to prevent overfishing.\\n\\nOutside of countries\\' exclusive economic zones, fishing is difficult to control. Large oceangoing fishing boats are free to exploit fish stocks at will.\\n\\nIn waters that are the subject of territorial disputes, countries may actively encourage overfishing. A notable example is the cod wars where Britain used its navy to protect its trawlers fishing in Iceland\\'s exclusive economic zone. Fish are highly transitory. Many species will freely move through different jurisdictions. The conservation efforts of one country can then be exploited by another.\\n\\nWhile governments can create regulations to control people\\'s behaviors this can be undermined by illegal fishing activity. Estimates of the size of the illegal catch range from 11 to 26 million tonnes, which represents 14-33% of the world\\'s reported catch. Illegal fishing can take many forms. In some developing countries, large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing. It can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing, especially for weak governments. Even in regulated environments, illegal fishing may occur. While industrial fishing is often effectively controlled, smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures. Fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching another. There is also a large problem with the surveillance of illegal fishing activity. In 2001, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), passed the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). This is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. It also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal fishing. Some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale with financed commercial operations.\\n\\nThe fishing capacity problem is not only related to the conservation of fish stocks but also to the sustainability of fishing activity. Causes of the fishing problem can be found in the property rights regime of fishing resources. Overexploitation and rent dissipation of fishermen arise in open-access fisheries as was shown in Gordon.\\n\\nIn open-access resources like fish stocks, in the absence of a system like individual transferable quotas, the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who want to increase catch to do so effectively by taking someone else\\' share, intensifying competition. This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely.\\n\\nResistance from fishermen\\nThere is always disagreement between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished area of the sea in the shape of a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what they are talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there\\'s lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly \\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Biodiversity\\n Bycatch\\n Catch and release\\n Environmental impact of fishing\\n Factory ship\\nPacific bluefin tuna\\nShark finning\\n Holocene extinction\\n Human overpopulation\\n Jellyfish blooms\\n Life history theory\\n List of harvested aquatic animals by weight\\n Natural environment\\n Maximum sustainable yield\\n Oceanic carbon cycle\\n Perverse subsidies\\n Population dynamics of fisheries\\n Sustainable fishing\\n The United Nations Ocean Conference\\n Tragedy of the commons\\n World Oceans Day\\n Overconsumption\\n\\n References \\n Citations \\n\\n Sources \\n\\n MN DNR.

       "       'An earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. They exhibit a tube-within-a-tube body plan, are externally segmented with corresponding internal segmentation, and usually have setae on all segments. They occur worldwide where soil, water, and temperature allow. Earthworms are commonly found in soil, eating a wide variety of organic matter. This organic matter includes plant matter, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. An earthworm\\'s digestive system runs the length of its body. It respires through its skin. It has a double transport system made of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed circulatory system. It has a central and peripheral nervous system. Its central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move digesting food toward the worm\\'s anus.\\n\\nEarthworms are hermaphrodites: each carries male and female reproductive organs. When mating, two individuals will exchange sperm and fertilize each other\\'s eggs. Each individual has both male and female genital pores. As invertebrates, they lack a true skeleton, but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\\n\\n\"Earthworm\" is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is a class or subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were in the order Opisthopora, since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\", \"nightcrawler\", and \"angleworm\" (from its use as fishing bait).\\n\\nLarger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (translates to \"big worms\"), opposed to the microdriles (\"small worms\") in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae, and Enchytraeidae. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct clitellum (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\\n\\nAnatomy\\n\\nForm and function \\n\\nDepending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from  long and  wide to  long and over  wide, but the typical Lumbricus terrestris grows to about  long. Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is Amynthas mekongianus that extends up to 3\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft)  in the mud along the banks of the 4,350\\xa0km (2,703\\xa0mi) Mekong River in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nFrom front to back, the basic shape of the earthworm is a cylindrical tube-in-a-tube, divided into a series of segments (called metamerisms) that compartmentalize the body. Furrows are generally externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephridiopores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm\\'s surface, allowing it to breathe. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristlelike hairs called lateral setae used to anchor parts of the body during movement; species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per segment. Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their mates.\\n\\nGenerally, within a species, the number of segments found is consistent across specimens, and individuals are born with the number of segments they will have throughout their lives. The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm\\'s mouth and, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the prostomium, which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm\\'s surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow.\\n\\nAn adult earthworm develops a belt-shaped glandular swelling, called the clitellum, which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The posterior is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, it may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened. The last segment is called the periproct; the earthworm\\'s anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment.\\n\\nThe exterior of an individual segment is a thin cuticle over the skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through the soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle. Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a coelom that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm\\'s boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of \"septum\") which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments. A pair of structures called nephrostomes are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the nephridium or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the coelomic fluid and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm\\'s sides; usually, two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments. At the centre of a worm is the digestive tract, which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the ventral nerve cord, and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.\\n\\nMany earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; the Australian Didymogaster sylvaticus (known as the \"blue squirter earthworm\") can squirt fluid as high as .\\n\\nNervous system\\n\\nCentral nervous system \\nThe CNS consists of a bilobed brain (cerebral ganglia, or supra-pharyngeal ganglion), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a ventral nerve cord.\\n\\nEarthworms\\' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia. These are located in the dorsal side of the alimentary canal in the third segment, in a groove between the buccal cavity and pharynx.\\n\\nA pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx.\\n\\nThe ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibers) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body. There are also three giant axons, one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord. The MGA is 0.07\\xa0mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2\\xa0m/s. The LGAs are slightly narrower at 0.05\\xa0mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6\\xa0m/s. The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.\\n\\nPeripheral nervous system \\nEight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the prostomium, buccal chamber and pharynx.\\nThree pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment.\\nThree pairs of nerves extend from each segmental ganglion to supply various structures of the segment.\\n\\nThe sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of connected nerve cells.) The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the cricopharyngeal connective.\\n\\nMovement \\n \\nOn the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals. Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer \"strides\" and a greater frequency of strides. Larger Lumbricus terrestris worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms. They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies.\\n\\nTouching an earthworm, which causes a \"pressure\" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contract. This causes the writhing movements observed when a human picks up an earthworm. This behaviour is a reflex and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus. The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments. The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments.\\n\\nThe giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).\\n\\nThe presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience nociception or pain. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics. Enkephalin and α-endorphin-like substances have been found in earthworms. Injections of naloxone (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms. This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many vertebrates.\\n\\nSensory reception\\n\\nPhotosensitivity\\n\\nEarthworms do not have eyes (although some worms do); however, they do have specialized photosensitive cells called \"light cells of Hess\". These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity (phaosome) filled with microvilli. As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory cilia in the phaosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli. The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm. A relatively small number occurs on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment.\\n\\nEpidermal receptor (Sense organ)\\n\\nThese receptors are abundant and distributed all over the epidermis. Each receptor shows a slightly elevated cuticle which covers a group of tall, slender and columnar receptor cells. These cells bear small hairlike processes at their outer ends and their inner ends are connected with nerve fibres. The epidermal receptors are tactile in function. They are also concerned with changes in temperature and respond to chemical stimuli. Earthworms are extremely sensitive to touch and mechanical vibration.\\n\\nBuccal receptor (Sense organ)\\n\\nThese receptors are located only in the epithelium of the buccal chamber. These receptors are gustatory and olfactory (related to taste and smell). They also respond to chemical stimuli. (Chemoreceptor)\\n\\nDigestive system \\nThe gut of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm\\'s mouth to its anus. It is differentiated into an alimentary canal and associated glands which are embedded in the wall of the alimentary canal itself. The alimentary canal consists of a mouth, buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), oesophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine.\\n\\nFood enters at the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes pepsin to digest proteins, amylase to digest polysaccharides, cellulase to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats. Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called drilodefensins, which help digest plant material. Instead of being coiled like a mammalian intestine, in an earthworm\\'s intestine a large mid-dorsal, tongue-like fold is present, called typhlosole which increases surface area to increase nutrient absorption by having many folds running along its length. The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order—an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer.\\n\\nCirculatory system \\nEarthworms have a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord.\\n\\nThe dorsal vessel is mainly a collecting structure in the intestinal region. It receives a pair commissural and dorsal intestines in each segment. The ventral vessel branches off to a pair of ventro-tegumentaries and ventro-intestinals in each segment. The subneural vessel also gives out a pair of commissurals running along the posterior surface of the septum.\\n\\nThe pumping action on the dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches ring the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and haemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing.\\n\\nExcretory system \\nThe excretory system contains a pair of nephridia in every segment, except for the first three and the last ones. The three types of nephridia are: integumentary, septal, and pharyngeal. The integumentary nephridia lie attached to the inner side of the body wall in all segments except the first two. The septal nephridia are attached to both sides of the septa behind the 15th segment. The pharyngeal nephridia are attached to the fourth, fifth and sixth segments. The waste in the coelom fluid from a forward segment is drawn in by the beating of cilia of the nephrostome. From there it is carried through the septum (wall) via a tube which forms a series of loops entwined by blood capillaries that also transfer waste into the tubule of the nephrostome. The excretory wastes are then finally discharged through a pore on the worm\\'s side.\\n\\nRespiration \\nEarthworms have no special respiratory organs. Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the haemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.\\n\\nLife and physiology \\nAt birth, earthworms emerge small but fully formed, lacking only their sex structures which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years.\\n\\nReproduction \\n\\nSeveral common earthworm species are mostly parthenogenetic, meaning that growth and development of embryos happens without fertilization.\\nAmong lumbricid earthworms, parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives many times.  Parthenogenesis in some Aporrectodea trapezoides lineages arose 6.4 to 1.1\\xa0million years ago from sexual ancestors.  A few species exhibit pseudogamous parthogenesis, meaning that mating is necessary to stimulate reproduction, even though no male genetic material passes to the offspring.\\n\\nEarthworm mating occurs on the surface, most often at night. Earthworms are hermaphrodites; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of testes contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of seminal vesicles produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of spermathecae are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation. As a result, segment 15 of one worm exudes sperm into segments 9 and 10 with its storage vesicles of its mate. Some species use external spermatophores for sperm transfer.\\n\\nIn Hormogaster samnitica and Hormogaster elisae transcriptome DNA libraries were sequenced and two sex pheromones, Attractin and Temptin, were detected in all tissue samples of both species. Sex pheromones are probably important in earthworms because they live in an environment where chemical signaling may play a crucial role in attracting a partner and in facilitating outcrossing. Outcrossing would provide the benefit of masking the expression of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny (see Complementation).\\n\\nCopulation and reproduction are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The clitellum becomes very reddish to pinkish in colour. Sometime after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm\\'s sperm into it. Thus each worm becomes the genetic father of some of their offspring and the genetic mother of the rest. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator (cocoon) in which the embryonic worms develop. Hence fertilization is external. The cocoon is then deposited in the soil. After three weeks, 2 to 20 offspring hatch with an average of 4. Development is direct i.e. without formation of any larva.\\n\\nLocomotion \\n\\nEarthworms travel underground by means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body (peristalsis). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny clawlike bristles (setae) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. As a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels, worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight.\\n\\nRegeneration \\nEarthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G. E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but \"because little interest was shown\", Gates (1972) published only a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species.\\n\\nGates\\'s reports included:\\nEisenia fetida (Savigny, 1826) with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21; thus two worms may grow from one.\\nLumbricus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758) replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found.\\nPerionyx excavatus (Perrier, 1872) readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21.\\nLampito mauritii (Kinberg, 1867) with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from Sarcophaga sp. larval infestation.\\nCriodrilus lacuum (Hoffmeister, 1845) also has prodigious regenerative capacity with \\'head\\' regeneration from as far back as 40/41.\\n\\nAn unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.\\n\\nTaxonomy and distribution \\nWithin the world of taxonomy, the stable \\'Classical System\\' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, \"The family-level classification of the megascolecid earthworms is in chaos.\" Over the years, many scientists have developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated. The classification system used here which was developed by Blakemore (2000), is a modern reversion to the Classical System that is historically proven and widely accepted.\\n\\nCategorization of a megadrile earthworm into one of its taxonomic families under suborders Lumbricina and Moniligastrida is based on such features as the makeup of the clitellum, the location and disposition of the sex features (pores, prostatic glands, etc.), number of gizzards, and body shape. Currently, over 6,000 species of terrestrial earthworms are named, as provided in a species name database, but the number of synonyms is unknown.\\n\\nThe families, with their known distributions or origins:\\n Acanthodrilidae\\n Ailoscolecidae – the Pyrenees and the southeast USA\\n Almidae – tropical equatorial (South America, Africa, Indo-Asia)\\n Benhamiinae – Ethiopian, Neotropical (a possible subfamily of Octochaetidae)\\n Criodrilidae – southwestern Palaearctic: Europe, Middle East, Russia and Siberia to Pacific coast; Japan (Biwadrilus); mainly aquatic\\n Diplocardiinae/-idae – Gondwanan or Laurasian? (a subfamily of Acanthodrilidae)\\n Enchytraeidae – cosmopolitan but uncommon in tropics (usually classed with Microdriles)\\n Eudrilidae – Tropical Africa south of the Sahara\\n Exxidae – Neotropical: Central America and the Caribbean\\n Glossoscolecidae – Neotropical: Central and  South America, Caribbean\\n Haplotaxidae – cosmopolitan distribution (usually classed with Microdriles)\\n Hormogastridae – Mediterranean\\n Kynotidae – Malagasian: Madagascar\\n Lumbricidae – Holarctic: North America, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia to Japan\\n Lutodrilidae – Louisiana the southeast USA\\n Megascolecidae\\n Microchaetidae – Terrestrial in Africa especially South African grasslands\\n Moniligastridae – Oriental and Indian subregion\\n Ocnerodrilidae – Neotropics, Africa; India\\n Octochaetidae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental, Ethiopian, Neotropical\\n Octochaetinae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental (subfamily if Benhamiinae is accepted)\\n Sparganophilidae – Nearctic, Neotropical: North and Central America\\n Tumakidae – Colombia, South America\\n\\nAs an invasive species \\n\\nFrom a total of around 7,000 species, only about 150 species are widely distributed around the world. These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.\\n\\nEcology \\n\\nEarthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at the soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (epigeic) e.g. Eisenia fetida; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within the soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10–30\\xa0 cm of soil (endogeic); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (anecic, meaning \"reaching up\"), e.g. Lumbricus terrestris.\\n\\nEarthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, aeration, and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is pH, but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favour neutral to slightly acidic soils. Lumbricus terrestris is still present in a pH of 5.4, Dendrobaena octaedra at a pH of 4.3 and some Megascolecidae are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into diapause. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4.\\n\\nEarthworms are preyed upon by many species of birds (e.g. robins, starlings, thrushes, gulls, crows), snakes, wood turtles, mammals (e.g. bears, boars, foxes, hedgehogs, pigs, moles) and invertebrates (e.g. ants, flatworms, ground beetles and other beetles, snails, spiders, and slugs). Earthworms have many internal parasites, including protozoa, platyhelminthes, and nematodes; they can be found in the worms\\' blood, seminal vesicles, coelom, or intestine, or in their cocoons.\\n\\nNitrogenous fertilizers tend to create acidic conditions, which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as DDT, lime sulphur, and lead arsenate. In Australia, changes in farming practices such as the application of superphosphates on pastures and a switch from pastoral farming to arable farming had a devastating effect on populations of the giant Gippsland earthworm, leading to their classification as a protected species. Globally, certain earthworms populations have been devastated by deviation from organic production and the spraying of synthetic fertilizers and biocides, with at least three species now listed as extinct but many more endangered.\\nThis earthworm activity aerates and mixes the soil, and is conducive to mineralization of nutrients and their uptake by vegetation. Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with soil fertility, an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by farmers and gardeners. As long ago as 1881 Charles Darwin wrote: \"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures.\"\\n\\nAlso, while, as the name suggests, the main habitat of earthworms is in soil, they are not restricted to this habitat. The brandling worm Eisenia fetida lives in decaying plant matter and manure. Arctiostrotus vancouverensis from Vancouver Island and the Olympic Peninsula is generally found in decaying conifer logs. Aporrectodea limicola, Sparganophilus spp.,  and several others are found in mud in streams.  Some species are arboreal, some aquatic and some euryhaline (salt-water tolerant) and littoral (living on the sea-shore, e.g. Pontodrilus litoralis). Even in the soil species, special habitats, such as soils derived from serpentine, have an earthworm fauna of their own.\\n\\nVermicomposting of organic \"wastes\" and addition of this organic matter to the soil, preferably as a surface mulch, will provide several species of earthworms with their food and nutrient requirements, and will create the optimum conditions of temperature and moisture that will stimulate their activity.\\n\\nEarthworms are environmental indicators of soil health. Earthworms feed on the decaying matter in the soil and analyzing the contents of their digestive tracts gives insight into the overall condition of the soil. The earthworm gut accumulates chemicals, including heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, zinc, and copper. The population size of the earthworm indicates the quality of the soil as healthy soil would contain a larger number of earthworms.\\n\\nEnvironmental impacts \\nThe major benefits of earthworm activities to soil fertility for agriculture can be summarized as:\\n Biological: In many soils, earthworms play a major role in the conversion of large pieces of organic matter into rich humus, thus improving soil fertility. This is achieved by the worm\\'s actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf, partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 percent more humus than the top 9\" (23\\xa0cm) of soil in which the worm is living.\\n\\n Chemical: In addition to dead organic matter, the earthworm also ingests any other soil particles that are small enough—including sand grains up to 1/20 of an inch (1.25\\xa0mm)—into its gizzard, wherein those minute fragments of grit grind everything into a fine paste which is then digested in the intestine. When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen, seven times richer in available phosphates, and 11 times richer in available potassium than the surrounding upper 6\\xa0inches (150\\xa0mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5\\xa0kg (10\\xa0lb) per worm per year.\\n Physical: The earthworm\\'s burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the soil structure, enabling processes of aeration and drainage. Permaculture co-founder Bill Mollison points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms \"act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)\". Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see Bioturbation). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil mucus) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality.  In podzol soils, earthworms can obliterate the characteristic banded appearance of the soil profile by mixing the organic (LFH), eluvial (E) and upper illuvial (B) horizons to create a single dark Ap horizon.\\n\\nEarthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through fragmentation & mixing of plant debris – physical grinding & chemical digestion. The earthworm\\'s existence cannot be taken for granted. Dr. W. E. Shewell-Cooper observed \"tremendous numerical differences between adjacent gardens\", and worm populations are affected by a host of environmental factors, many of which can be influenced by good management practices on the part of the gardener or farmer.\\n\\nDarwin estimated that arable land contains up to 53,000 worms per acre (13/m2), but more recent research has produced figures suggesting that even poor soil may support 250,000/acre (62/m2), whilst rich fertile farmland may have up to 1,750,000/acre (432/m2), meaning that the weight of earthworms beneath a farmer\\'s soil could be greater than that of the livestock upon its surface. Richly organic topsoil populations of earthworms are much higher – averaging 500 worms m−2 and up to 400 gm−2 – such that, for the 7\\xa0billion of us, each person alive today has support of 7\\xa0million earthworms.\\n\\nThe ability to break down organic materials and excrete concentrated nutrients makes the earthworm a functional contributor in restoration projects. In response to ecosystem disturbances, some sites have utilized earthworms to prepare soil for the return of native flora. Research from the Station d\\'écologie Tropicale de Lamto asserts that the earthworms positively influence the rate of macroaggregate formation, an important feature for soil structure. The stability of aggregates in response to water was also found to be improved when constructed by earthworms.\\n\\nThough not fully quantified yet, Greenhouse gas emissions of earthworms likely contribute to global warming, especially since top-dwelling earthworms increase the speed of carbon cycles and have been spread by humans into many new geographies.\\n\\nEconomic impact \\n\\nVarious species of worms are used in vermiculture, the practice of feeding organic waste to earthworms to decompose food waste. These are usually Eisenia fetida (or its close relative Eisenia andrei) or the Brandling worm, commonly known as the tiger worm or red wiggler. They are distinct from soil-dwelling earthworms. In the tropics, the African nightcrawler Eudrilus eugeniae and the Indian blue Perionyx excavatus are used.\\n\\nEarthworms are sold all over the world; the market is sizable. According to Doug Collicut, \"In 1980, 370 million worms were exported from Canada, with a Canadian export value of $13 million and an American retail value of $54 million.\"\\n\\nEarthworms provide an excellent source of protein for fish, fowl and pigs but were also used traditionally for human consumption. Noke is a culinary term used by the Māori of New Zealand, and refers to earthworms which are considered delicacies for their chiefs.\\n\\nSee also \\n Drilosphere, the part of the soil  influenced by earthworm secretions and castings\\n The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, an 1881 book by Charles Darwin\\n Soil life\\n Vermicompost\\n Vermifilter\\n Vermifilter toilet\\n Worm charming\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading \\n Edwards, Clive A., Bohlen, P.J.

They are found above the kidneys.\\nAllergy – Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.\\nADHD – Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\nAlzheimer\\'s disease – (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer\\'s, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss).\\nAnal canal – is the terminal part of the large intestine. It is situated between the rectum and anus, below the level of the pelvic diaphragm. In humans it is approximately 2.5 to 4\\xa0cm (0.98-1.58\\xa0in) long. It lies in the anal triangle of perineum in between the right and left ischioanal fossa.\\nAnatomy – is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts. Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things.\\nAnesthesiology – Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology, anaesthesia or anaesthetics (see Terminology) is the medical speciality concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery.\\nAngiology – is the medical specialty which studies the diseases of the circulatory system and of the lymphatic system, i.e., arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels, and its diseases.\\nAnkle – The ankle, or the talocrural region, is the region where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, \"ankle\" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint.\\nAnterior tibial artery – The anterior tibial artery of the leg carries blood to the anterior compartment of the leg and dorsal surface of the foot, from the popliteal artery.\\nAntibiotic – is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria and is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections. Antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections.\\nAntibody – (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses.\\nAorta –  is the main artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.\\nAppendix –  The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. The cecum is a pouch-like structure of the colon, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term \"vermiform\" comes from Latin and means \"worm-shaped.\" The appendix used to be considered a vestigial organ, but this view has changed over the past decades.\\nArm – is the part of the upper limb between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint.  In common usage, the arm extends to the hand. It can be divided into the upper arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, the forearm which extends from the elbow to the hand, and the hand. Anatomically the shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a part of the arm. The Latin term brachium may refer to either the arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.\\nArteriole – is a small-diameter blood vessel in the microcirculation that extends and branches out from an artery and leads to capillaries.  Arterioles have muscular walls (usually only one to two layers of smooth muscle) and are the primary site of vascular resistance. The greatest change in blood pressure and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to capillaries.\\nArtery – is a blood vessel that takes blood  away from the heart to all parts of the body (tissues, lungs, etc.). Most arteries carry oxygenated blood; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood to the organs that oxygenate it. The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system.\\nArthritis – is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.\\nAS – Asperger syndrome.\\nAsperger syndrome – (AS), also known as Asperger\\'s, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.\\nAsthma – is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.\\nAtony – absence of muscle tone.\\nAtrial fibrillation – (AF or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms.\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder – is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person\\'s age. \\nAuscultation – is listening to the internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope. Auscultation is performed for the purposes of examining the circulatory and respiratory systems (heart and breath sounds), as well as the gastrointestinal system.\\nAutism – is a developmental disorder characterized by troubles with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs during the first two or three years of their child\\'s life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace before worsening.\\nAxilla – (also, armpit, underarm  or oxter) is the area on the human body directly under the joint where the arm connects to the shoulder. It also provides the under-arm sweat gland.\\nAxillary artery – is a large blood vessel that conveys oxygenated blood to the lateral aspect of the thorax, the axilla (armpit) and the upper limb.  Its origin is at the lateral margin of the first rib, before which it is called the subclavian artery.\\n\\nB\\nBack – The human back is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck and the shoulders. It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest. The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom.\\nBack pain – is pain felt in the back. It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body.  Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\\nBasal\\nAnatomy: In the direction of the base. Antonym apical.\\nPhysiology: Lowest sustained level or minimum level required, as in basal metabolic rate.\\nBeta cell – Beta cells (β cells) are a type of cell found in pancreatic islets that synthesize and secrete insulin. Beta cells make up 50-70% of the cells in human islets. In patients with type I or type II diabetes, beta-cell mass and function are diminished, leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia.\\nBiceps – also biceps brachii (Latin for \"two-headed muscle of the arm\"), is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is attached to the upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm.  Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion).\\nBiceps brachii – The biceps, also biceps brachii (Latin for \"two-headed muscle of the arm\"), is a large muscle that lies on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. Both heads of the muscle arise on the scapula and join to form a single muscle belly which is attached to the upper forearm. While the biceps crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints, its main function is at the elbow where it flexes the forearm and supinates the forearm.  Both these movements are used when opening a bottle with a corkscrew: first biceps unscrews the cork (supination), then it pulls the cork out (flexion).\\nBile duct –  is any of a number of long tube-like structures that carry bile. Bile, required for the digestion of food, is secreted by the liver into passages that carry bile toward the hepatic duct, which joins with the cystic duct (carrying bile to and from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct, which opens into the intestine.\\nBiliary tract – The biliary tract, (biliary tree or biliary system) refers to the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts, and how they work together to make, store and secrete bile. Bile consists of water, electrolytes, bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids and conjugated bilirubin. Some components are synthesised by hepatocytes (liver cells), the rest are extracted from the blood by the liver.\\nBinge eating disorder – (BED), is an eating disorder characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).  BED is a recently described condition, which was required to distinguish binge eating similar to that seen in bulimia nervosa but without characteristic purging. Individuals who are diagnosed with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder exhibit similar patterns of compulsive overeating, neurobiological features of dysfunctional cognitive control and food addiction, and biological and environmental risk factors. Indeed, some consider BED a milder version of bulimia, and that the conditions are on the same spectrum.\\nBiological engineering –  or bioengineering, or bio-engineering, is the application of principles of biology and the tools of engineering to create usable, tangible, economically viable products.  Biological engineering employs knowledge and expertise from a number of pure and applied sciences, such as mass and heat transfer, kinetics, biocatalysts, biomechanics, bioinformatics, separation and purification processes, bioreactor design, surface science, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and polymer science. It is used in the design of medical devices, diagnostic equipment, biocompatible materials, renewable bioenergy, ecological engineering, agricultural engineering, and other areas that improve the living standards of societies.\\nBiology – is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution.\\nBiochemistry – sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. \\nBioinformatics – is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data.\\nBiopsy – is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease.\\nBiostatistics –  are the application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology. It encompasses the design of biological experiments, especially in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and fishery; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. A major branch is medical biostatistics, which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.\\nBipolar disorder – is a mental disorder that causes periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood\\nBirth control – also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy.\\nBladder cancer – is any of several types of cancer arising from the tissues of the urinary bladder. It is a disease in which cells grow abnormally and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body. Symptoms include blood in the urine, pain with urination, and low back pain.\\nBlood pressure –   is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Used without further specification, \"blood pressure\" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation.  Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heartbeats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure.\\nBlood vessel – The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system, and microcirculation, that transports blood throughout the human body.\\nBone – is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions.\\nBone marrow – is a semi-solid tissue which may be found within the spongy or cancellous portions of bones. Bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis. It is composed of hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, and supportive stromal cells. In adult humans, bone marrow is primarily located in the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and bones of the pelvis. On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass (143\\xa0lb), bone marrow typically accounts for approximately .\\nBrachial artery – is the major blood vessel of the (upper) arm. It is the continuation of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the cubital fossa at the elbow. It then divides into  the radial and ulnar arteries which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm. The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, with the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the blood pressure.\\nBrachial plexus – is a network of nerves formed by the ventral rami of the lower four cervical nerves and first thoracic nerve (C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1). This plexus extends from the spinal cord, through the cervicoaxillary canal in the neck, over the first rib, and into the armpit. It supplies afferent and efferent nerve fibers to the chest, shoulder, arm and hand.\\nBrachial veins – In human anatomy, the brachial veins are venae comitantes of the brachial artery in the arm proper.  Because they are deep to muscle, they are considered deep veins.  Their course is that of the brachial artery (in reverse): they begin where radial veins and ulnar veins join (corresponding to the bifurcation of the brachial artery).  They end at the inferior border of the teres major muscle.  At this point, the brachial veins join the basilic vein to form the axillary vein. The brachial veins also have small tributaries that drain the muscles of the upper arm, such as biceps brachii muscle and triceps brachii muscle.\\nBrachioradialis –  is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus.\\nBradycardia –is a condition typically defined wherein an individual has a resting heart rate of under 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults.\\nBrain – The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.\\nBrain tumor –  occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors.\\nBrain metastasis – is a cancer that has metastasized (spread) to the brain from another location in the body and is therefore considered a secondary brain tumor. The metastasis typically shares a cancer cell type with the original site of the cancer.\\nBreast – The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates.  Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy.\\nBreast cancer – is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.\\nBroca\\'s area – or the Broca area, is a region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, usually the left, of the brain with functions linked to speech production.\\nBronchiole – The bronchioles or bronchioli are the passageways by which air passes through the nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs, in which branches no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa. They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region.\\nBronchus – A bronchi is a passage of airway in the respiratory system that conducts air into the lungs. The first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest and enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.  The bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\\nBruit – also called vascular murmur, is the abnormal sound generated by turbulent flow of blood in an artery due to either an area of partial obstruction or a localized high rate of blood flow through an unobstructed artery. \\nBulimia nervosa – also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed.\\nButtocks – are two rounded portions of the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. Physiologically, the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting.\\n\\nC\\nCalcium – Calcium ions (Ca2+) contribute to the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor, those of the blood-clotting cascade being notable examples. Extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.\\n\\nCalf – is the back portion of the lower leg in human anatomy. The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles attach to the knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes.\\nCancer – is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body.\\nCapillary – is a small blood vessel from 5 to 10 micrometres (µm) in diameter, and having a wall one endothelial cell thick. They are the smallest blood vessels in the body: they convey blood between the arterioles and venules. These microvessels are the site of exchange of  many substances with the interstitial fluid surrounding them.\\nCarcinogen – is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that promotes carcinogenesis, the formation of cancer. This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.\\nCarcinogenesis – also called oncogenesis or tumorigenesis, is the formation of a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells.\\nCardiac arrest – a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to effectively pump. Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some individuals may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before cardiac arrest. If not treated within minutes, it typically leads to death.\\nCardiac catheterization – (heart cath or just cath), is the insertion of a catheter into a chamber or vessel of the heart. This is done both for diagnostic and interventional purposes.\\nCardiac muscle – (also called heart muscle or myocardium), is one of three types of vertebrate muscles, with the other two being skeletal and smooth muscles. It is an involuntary, striated muscle that constitutes the main tissue of the walls of the heart. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer layer of the heart wall (the epicardium) and the inner layer (the endocardium), with blood supplied via the coronary circulation.  It is composed of individual heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) joined by intercalated discs, encased by collagen fibres and other substances that form the extracellular matrix.\\nCardiac surgery –  or cardiovascular surgery, is surgery on the heart or great vessels performed by cardiac surgeons. It is often used to treat complications of ischemic heart disease (for example, with coronary artery bypass grafting); to correct congenital heart disease; or to treat valvular heart disease from various causes, including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, and atherosclerosis. It also includes heart transplantation.\\nCardiology – is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart as well as parts of the circulatory system.\\nCardiothoracic surgery – (also known as thoracic surgery) is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of organs inside the thorax (the chest)—generally treatment of conditions of the heart (heart disease) and lungs (lung disease).\\nCardiovascular disease – (CVD), is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack). Other CVDs include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.\\nCarotid artery, common – In anatomy, the left and right common carotid arteries (carotids) ) are arteries that supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood; they divide in the neck to form the external and internal carotid arteries.\\nCarotid artery, external – The external carotid artery is a major artery of the head and neck.  It arises from the common carotid artery when it splits into the external and internal carotid artery. It supplies blood to the face and neck.\\nCarotid artery, internal – The internal carotid artery is a major paired artery, one on each side of the head and neck, in human anatomy. They arise from the common carotid arteries where these bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries at cervical vertebral level 3 or 4; the internal carotid artery supplies the brain, while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as face, scalp, skull, and meninges.\\nCarotid artery stenosis – is a narrowing or constriction of any part of the carotid arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis.\\nCarpal bones – Are the eight small bones that make up the wrist (or carpus) that connects the hand to the forearm.  In human anatomy, the main role of the wrist is to facilitate effective positioning of the hand and powerful use of the extensors and flexors of the forearm, and the mobility of individual carpal bones increase the freedom of movements at the wrist.\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome –  (CTS), is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms are pain, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the thumb side of the ring fingers.\\nCartilage – is a resilient and smooth  elastic tissue, a rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The matrix of cartilage is made up of chondrin.\\nCartilaginous joint – Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline).  Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint.  Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column.\\nCatheter – Is a thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions. Catheters are medical devices that can be inserted in the body to treat diseases or perform a surgical procedure. By modifying the material or adjusting the way catheters are manufactured, it is possible to tailor catheters for cardiovascular, urological, gastrointestinal, neurovascular, and ophthalmic applications.\\nCeliac disease – another way of spelling coeliac disease\\nCell biology – also called cytology, is a branch of biology that studies the structure and function of the cell, which is the basic unit of life. Cell biology is concerned with the physiological properties, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, life cycle, chemical composition and interactions of the cell with their environment.\\nCentral nervous system – (CNS), is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord.\\nCephalic vein –   is a superficial vein in the arm. It communicates with the basilic vein via the median cubital vein at the elbow and is located in the superficial fascia along the anterolateral surface of the biceps brachii muscle. Near the shoulder, the cephalic vein passes between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles (deltopectoral groove) and through the deltopectoral triangle, where it empties into the axillary vein.\\nCerebellum – (Latin for \"little brain\"), is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates.  Although usually smaller than the cerebrum, in some animals such as the mormyrid fishes it may be as large as or even larger. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The human cerebellum does not initiate movement, but contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing: it receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine-tune motor activity. Cerebellar damage produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning in humans.\\nCerebrum – is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In the human brain, the cerebrum is the uppermost region of the central nervous system. The prosencephalon is the embryonic structure from which the cerebrum develops prenatally. In mammals, the dorsal telencephalon, or pallium, develops into the cerebral cortex, and the ventral telencephalon, or subpallium, becomes the basal ganglia. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric left and right cerebral hemispheres.  With the assistance of the cerebellum, the cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the body.\\nCervical cancer – is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer.\\nCervix – or cervix uteri,  is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system. The cervix is usually 2 to 3\\xa0cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape, which changes during pregnancy. The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina.\\nCheek – The cheeks  constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. \"Buccal\" means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth.\\nChin – is the area of the face below the lower lip and including the mandibular prominence. It is formed by the lower front of the mandible.\\nChronic fatigue syndrome – (CFS), also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other persistent symptoms that limit a person\\'s ability to carry out ordinary daily activities.\\nCiliary muscle –  is a ring of smooth muscle in the eye\\'s middle layer (vascular layer) that controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances and regulates the flow of aqueous humor into Schlemm\\'s canal. It changes the shape of the lens within the eye, not the size of the pupil which is carried out by the sphincter pupillae muscle and dilator pupillae.\\nCirculatory system –  The circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system, is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases, stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain homeostasis.\\nClavicle – also known as the collar bone, is a long bone that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum. There are two, one on the right, and one on the left side of the trunk. Along with the shoulder blade, the clavicles make up the shoulder girdle. The clavicle has many functions. It connects the axial and appendicular skeleton in conjunction with the scapula, helps extend range of motion, and protects neurovascular structures.\\nClinic – (or outpatient clinic or ambulatory care clinic) is a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded.\\nClinical research – is a branch of healthcare science that determines the safety and effectiveness (efficacy) of medications, devices, diagnostic products and treatment regimens intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment.\\nCoeliac disease – Coeliac disease or celiac disease is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine. Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite and among children failure to grow normally. This often begins between six months and two years of age. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body or no obvious symptoms. Coeliac disease was first described in childhood; however, it may develop at any age. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others.\\nColorectal surgery –  is a field in medicine dealing with disorders of the rectum, anus, and colon.\\nCommon carotid artery – In anatomy, the left and right common carotid arteries (carotids) ) are arteries that supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood; they divide in the neck to form the external and internal carotid arteries.\\nCommon cold –  also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks. Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia.\\nCommon iliac artery – The common iliac arteries are two large arteries that originate from the aortic bifurcation at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. They end in front of the sacroiliac joint, one on either side, and each bifurcates into the external and internal iliac arteries.\\nCommon iliac vein – The common iliac veins are formed by the external iliac veins and internal iliac veins. The left and right common iliac veins come together in the abdomen at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, forming the inferior vena cava.  They drain blood from the pelvis and lower limbs.  Both common iliac veins are accompanied along their course by common iliac arteries.\\n\\nCoronary arteries – are the blood vessels (arteries) of coronary circulation, which transports oxygenated blood to the actual heart muscle. The heart requires a continuous supply of oxygen to function and survive, much like any other tissue or organ of the body.\\nCorpus callosum – also callosal commissure, is a wide, thick nerve tract consisting of a flat bundle of commissural fibers, beneath the cerebral cortex in the brain. The corpus callosum is only found in placental mammals.  It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication between them. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, about ten centimetres in length and consisting of 200–300 million axonal projections.\\nCranial nerves – are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain (including the brainstem), in contrast to spinal nerves (which emerge from segments of the spinal cord). Ten of the cranial nerves originate in the brainstem.  Cranial nerves relay information between the brain and parts of the body, primarily to and from regions of the head and neck.\\nCure – is a substance or procedure that ends a medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person\\'s sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured.\\nCytogenetics – is a branch of genetics that is concerned with how the chromosomes relate to cell behaviour, particularly to their behaviour during mitosis and meiosis.\\nCytokines –    are a broad and loose category of small proteins (~5–20 kDa) that are important in cell signaling.  Cytokines are peptides, and cannot cross the lipid bilayer of cells to enter the cytoplasm.\\n\\nD\\nDeep circumflex iliac vein – is formed by the union of the venae comitantes of the deep iliac circumflex artery, and joins the external iliac vein about 2\\xa0cm. above the inguinal ligament.  It also receives small tributary branches from the thoracoepigastric vein\\nDeep temporal arteries – The deep temporal arteries, two in number, anterior and posterior, ascend between the temporalis and the pericranium.  They supply the muscle, and anastomose with the middle temporal artery.  The anterior communicates with the lacrimal artery by means of small branches which perforate the zygomatic bone and great wing of the sphenoid.\\nDeltoid muscle – is the muscle forming the rounded contour of the human shoulder.  Anatomically, it appears to be made up of three distinct sets of fibers though electromyography suggests that it consists of at least seven groups that can be independently coordinated by the nervous system.\\nDentistry – also known as Dental and Oral Medicine, is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity, commonly in the dentition  but also the oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.\\nDermatitis – also known as eczema, is a group of diseases that result in inflammation of the skin. These diseases are characterized by itchiness, red skin and a rash. In cases of short duration, there may be small blisters, while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened. The area of skin involved can vary from small to the entire body.\\nDiagnosis – Medical diagnosis (abbreviated Dx or DS) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person\\'s symptoms and signs. It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.\\nDiabetes mellitus – (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.\\nDietary reference intake – (DRI), is a system of nutrition recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (United States).\\nDifferential diagnosis – is the distinguishing of a particular disease or condition from others that present similar clinical features.\\nDigestive system – The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body.\\nDisease – is an abnormal condition in an organism, or part of it, that negatively affects structure or function. Disease can be caused by external factors, or internal dysfunctions, such as abnormal immune responses.\\n\\nE\\n\\nEar – is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \"ear\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.\\nEar infection –  Otitis is a general term for inflammation or infection of the ear, in both humans and other animals.  It is subdivided into the following:\\nOtitis externa, external otitis, or \"swimmer\\'s ear\", involves the outer ear and ear canal. In external otitis, the ear hurts when touched or pulled.\\nOtitis media, or middle ear infection, involves the middle ear. In otitis media, the ear is infected or clogged with fluid behind the ear drum, in the normally air-filled middle-ear space. This very common childhood infection sometimes requires a surgical procedure called myringotomy and tube insertion.\\nOtitis interna, or labyrinthitis, involves the inner ear. The inner ear includes sensory organs for balance and hearing. When the inner ear is inflamed, vertigo is a common symptom.\\nElbow – is the visible joint between the upper and lower parts of the arm. It includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon, the elbow pit, the lateral and medial epicondyles, and the elbow joint. The elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved towards and away from the body.\\nEmbryology –  is the branch of biology that studies the prenatal development of gametes (sex cells), fertilization, and development of embryos and fetuses. Additionally, embryology encompasses the study of congenital disorders that occur before birth, known as teratology.\\nEmergency medicine – also known as accident and emergency medicine, is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. Emergency physicians care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages. As first-line providers, their primary responsibility is to initiate resuscitation and stabilization and to start investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase.\\nEndocrine system – is a chemical messenger system comprising feedback loops of hormones released by internal glands of an organism directly into the circulatory system, regulating distant target organs. In humans, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands.  In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as endocrinology. Endocrinology is a branch of internal medicine.\\nEndocrinology –   is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its specific secretions known as hormones. It is also concerned with the integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and the psychological or behavioral activities of metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception caused by hormones. Specializations include behavioral endocrinology and comparative endocrinology.\\nEpidemiology –  is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where), patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations. It is a cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.\\nEpiglottis –  is a leaf-shaped flap in the throat that prevents food from entering the windpipe and the lungs. It stands open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. During swallowing, it closes to prevent aspiration of food into the lungs, forcing the swallowed liquids or food to go along the esophagus toward the stomach instead. It is thus the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus.\\nEpilepsy –  is a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries, including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures have a tendency to recur and, as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. \\nErectile dysfunction –  (ED), also called impotence, is the type of sexual dysfunction in which the penis fails to become or stay erect during sexual activity. It is the most common sexual problem in men. Through its connection to self-image and to problems in sexual relationships, erectile dysfunction can cause psychological harm.\\nErector spinae muscles –  The erector spinae or spinal erectors is a set of muscles that straighten and rotate the back.\\nEsophagus –  The esophagus, (American English) or oesophagus (British English; see spelling differences) (), informally known as the food pipe or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, about  long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs.\\nExtensor pollicis brevis muscle – In human anatomy, the extensor pollicis brevis is a skeletal muscle on the dorsal side of the forearm.  It lies on the medial side of, and is closely connected with, the abductor pollicis longus.\\nExtensor pollicis et indicis communis muscle –  In human anatomy, the extensor pollicis et indicis communis is an aberrant muscle in the posterior compartment of forearm. It was first described in 1863.  The muscle has a prevalence from 0.5% to 4%.\\nExtensor pollicis longus muscle –  In human anatomy, the extensor pollicis longus muscle (EPL) is a skeletal muscle located dorsally on the forearm.  It is much larger than the extensor pollicis brevis, the origin of which it partly covers and acts to stretch the thumb together with this muscle.\\nExternal carotid artery –  is a major artery of the head and neck.  It arises from the common carotid artery when it splits into the external and internal carotid artery. External carotid artery supplies blood to the face and neck.\\nExternal iliac artery –  The external iliac arteries are two major arteries which bifurcate off the common iliac arteries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis.\\nExternal iliac vein –  The external iliac veins are large veins that connect the femoral veins to the common iliac veins.  Their origin is at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligaments and they terminate when they join the internal iliac veins (to form the common iliac veins).  Both external iliac veins are accompanied along their course by external iliac arteries.\\nExternal jugular vein –  receives the greater part of the blood from the exterior of the cranium and the deep parts of the face, being formed by the junction of the posterior division of the retromandibular vein with the posterior auricular vein.\\nEye –  The human eye is a sense organ that reacts to light and allows vision. Rod and cone cells in the retina are photoreceptive cells which are able to detect visible light and convey this information to the brain. Eyes signal information which is used by the brain to elicit the perception of color, shape, depth, movement, and other features. The eye is part of the sensory nervous system. Similar to the eyes of other mammals, the human eye\\'s non-image-forming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil, regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin, and entrainment of the circadian rhythm.\\nEye surgery –\\n\\nF\\nFace – is the front of an animal\\'s head that features three of the head\\'s sense organs, the eyes, nose, and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities affects the psyche adversely.\\nFallopian tube –  The Fallopian tubes, also known as uterine tubes or salpinges (singular salpinx), are tubes that stretch from the uterus to the ovaries, and are part of the female reproductive system.  The fertilized egg passes through the Fallopian tubes from the ovaries of female mammals to the uterus. The Fallopian tubes is simple columnar epithelium with hair-like extensions called cilia which carry the fertilized egg. In other animals, the equivalent of a Fallopian tube is an oviduct.\\nFellowship (medicine) –  is the period of medical training, in the United States and Canada, that a physician, dentist, or veterinarian may undertake after completing a specialty training program (residency). During this time (usually more than one year), the physician is known as a fellow. Fellows are capable of acting as an attending physician or a consultant physician in the specialist field in which they were trained, such as Internal Medicine or Pediatrics. After completing a fellowship in the relevant sub-specialty, the physician is permitted to practice without direct supervision by other physicians in that sub-specialty, such as Cardiology or Oncology.\\nFemale reproductive system –  is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth and  develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a foetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces vaginal  and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix.\\nFemoral artery –  is a large artery in the thigh and the main arterial supply to the thigh and leg. It enters the thigh from behind the inguinal ligament as the continuation of the external iliac artery.\\nFemoral nerve –  is a nerve in the thigh that supplies skin on the upper thigh and inner leg, and the muscles that extend the knee.\\nFemoral vein –  In the human body, the femoral vein is a blood vessel that accompanies the femoral artery in the femoral sheath. It begins at the adductor hiatus (an opening in the adductor magnus muscle) and is a continuation of the popliteal vein.  It ends at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament, where it becomes the external iliac vein. The femoral vein bears valves which are mostly bicuspid and whose number is variable between individuals and often between left and right leg.\\nFemur –  The femur, or thigh bone, is the proximal bone of the hindlimb in tetrapod vertebrate, the largest bone of the human body. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap, forming the knee joint.\\nFibromyalgia –\\nFibrous joint –\\nFibula –\\nFinger –\\nFirst aid –\\nFlat bone –\\nFoot –\\nForearm –\\nForehead –\\nFrontal bone –\\nFrontal nerve –  Is the largest branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1), itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).  The frontal nerve branches from the ophthalmic nerve immediately before entering the superior orbital fissure. In then travels superolateral to the annulus of Zinn between the lacrimal nerve and inferior ophthalmic vein. After entering the orbit it travels anteriorly between the roof periosteum and the levator palpebrae superioris. Midway between the apex and base of the orbit it divides into two branches, the supratrochlear nerve and supraorbital nerve.  The two branches of the frontal nerve provide sensory innervation to the skin of the forehead, mucosa of the frontal sinus, and the skin of the upper eyelid.\\nFrontalis muscle –\\n\\nG\\nGallbladder – In vertebrates, the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives and stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.\\nGamete –  is a haploid cell that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization in organisms that reproduce sexually. Gametes are an organism\\'s reproductive cells, also referred to as sex cells. \\nGanglion –  is a group of neuron cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system. In the somatic nervous system this includes dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia among a few others. In the autonomic nervous system there are both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia which contain the cell bodies of postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons respectively.\\nGastrocnemius muscle –  (plural gastrocnemii) is a superficial two-headed muscle that is in the back part of the lower leg of humans.  It runs from its two heads just above the knee to the heel, a three joint muscle (knee, ankle and subtalar joints). The muscle is named via Latin, from Greek γαστήρ (gaster) \\'belly\\' or \\'stomach\\' and κνήμη (knḗmē) \\'leg\\', meaning \\'stomach of leg\\' (referring to the bulging shape of the calf).\\nGastroenterology –  Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders.  Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which include the organs from mouth into anus, along the alimentary canal, are the focus of this speciality. \\nGastrointestinal tract –  The gastrointestinal tract, (GI tract, GIT, digestive tract, digestion tract, alimentary canal) is the tract from the mouth to the anus which includes all the organs of the digestive system in humans and other animals. Food taken in through the mouth is digested to extract nutrients and absorb energy, and the waste expelled as feces. The mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines are all part of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines. A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs.\\nGene therapy –   (also called human gene transfer) is a medical field which focuses on the utilization of the therapeutic delivery of nucleic acids into a patient\\'s cells as a drug to treat disease. \\nGeneral surgery –  is a surgical specialty that focuses on abdominal contents including esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, appendix and bile ducts, and often the thyroid gland (depending on local referral patterns). They also deal with diseases involving the skin, breast, soft tissue, trauma,  Peripheral artery disease and hernias and perform endoscopic procedures such as gastroscopy and colonoscopy.\\nGenetics –  is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms.\\nGenitourinary system –  The genitourinary system, or urogenital system, are the organs of the reproductive system and the urinary system. These are grouped together because of their proximity to each other, their common embryological origin and the use of common pathways, like the male urethra. Also, because of their proximity, the systems are sometimes imaged together.  \\nGeriatrics –  or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. Rather, this decision is determined by the individual patient\\'s needs, and the availability of a specialist. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people, and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.\\nGonad –  A gonad, sex gland, or reproductive gland is a mixed gland that produces the gametes (sex cells) and sex hormones of an organism. In the female of the species the reproductive cells are the egg cells, and in the male the reproductive cells are the sperm. The male gonad, the testicle, produces sperm in the form of spermatozoa. The female gonad, the ovary, produces egg cells. Both of these gametes are haploid cells. Some hermaphroditic animals have a type of gonad called an ovotestis.\\nGout – is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.\\nGracilis muscle –  is the most superficial muscle on the medial side of the thigh. It is thin and flattened, broad above, narrow and tapering below.\\nGreat saphenous vein –  (GSV, alternately \"long saphenous vein\"; ) is a large, subcutaneous, superficial vein of the leg. It is the longest vein in the body, running along the length of the lower limb, returning blood from the foot, leg and thigh to the deep femoral vein at the femoral triangle.\\nGynaecology –  or gynecology (see spelling differences) is the medical practice dealing with the health of the female reproductive system. Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians (see obstetrics and gynaecology).  In many areas, the specialities of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap.  The term means \"the science of women\". Its counterpart is andrology, which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system.\\n\\nH\\nHand – A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates. The human hand normally has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including sesmoid bones, the number of which varies between people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.\\nHand surgery –  deals with both surgical and non-surgical treatment of conditions and problems that may take place in the hand or upper extremity (commonly from the tip of the hand to the shoulder) including injury and infection. Hand surgery may be practiced by graduates of general surgery, orthopedic surgery and plastic surgery. Chiroplasty, or cheiroplasty, is plastic surgery of the hands.\\nHead –  In human anatomy, the head is at the top of the human body. It supports the face and is maintained by the skull, which itself encloses the brain.  The human head consists of a fleshy outer portion, which surrounds the bony skull. The brain is enclosed within the skull.  There are 22 bones in the human head. The head rests on the neck, and the seven cervical vertebrae support it. The human head typically weighs between   The face is the anterior part of the head, containing the eyes, nose, and mouth. On either side of the mouth, the cheeks provide a fleshy border to the oral cavity. The ears sit to either side of the head.\\nHealth –  as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" This definition has been subject to controversy, as it may have limited value for implementation. Health may be defined as the ability to adapt and manage physical, mental and social challenges throughout life.\\nHealth care –  Health care, health-care, or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Physicians and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. Dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, medicine, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.\\nHearing –\\nHeart –\\nHeel –\\nHematemesis-\\nHematology –\\nHematoma-\\nHematuria-\\nHemodialysis-\\nHemolysis-\\nHemopathy-\\nHemoperfusion-\\nHemophilia-\\nHemoptysis-\\nHemorrhoid-\\nHyperhydrosis-\\nHigh blood pressure –\\nHyperkalemia-\\nHip bone –\\nHistology –\\nHomeostasis –\\nHormone –\\nHospice –\\nHospital –\\nHospital medicine –\\nHuman back –\\nHuman body –\\nHuman brain –\\nHuman digestive system –\\nHuman eye –\\nHuman head –\\nHuman mouth –\\nHuman musculoskeletal system –\\nHuman nose –\\nHuman reproductive system –\\nHuman skeleton –\\nHumerus –\\nHypersalivation –\\nHypertension –\\n\\nI\\nIliac artery, common – The common iliac arteries are two large arteries that originate from the aortic bifurcation at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. They end in front of the sacroiliac joint, one on either side, and each bifurcates into the external and internal iliac arteries.\\nIliac artery, external –  The external iliac arteries are two major arteries which bifurcate off the common iliac arteries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis.  They proceed anterior and inferior along the medial border of the psoas major muscles.  They exit the pelvic girdle posterior and inferior to the inguinal ligament about one third laterally from the insertion point of the inguinal ligament on the pubic tubercle at which point they are referred to as the femoral arteries. The external iliac artery is usually the artery used to attach the renal artery to the recipient of a kidney transplant.\\nIlium – (plural ilia), is the uppermost and largest part of the hip bone, and appears in most vertebrates including mammals and birds, but not bony fish.  All reptiles have an ilium except snakes, although some snake species have a tiny bone which is considered to be an ilium.  The ilium of the human is divisible into two parts, the body and the wing; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum.\\nImmune system –  is a network of biological processes that protects an organism against disease. It detects and responds to a wide variety of pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, as well as objects such as wood splinters,  distinguishing them from the organism\\'s own healthy tissue. Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered.  Both use molecules and cells to perform their functions.\\nImmunohistochemistry –\\nImmunology –  is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms. Immunology charts, measures, and contextualizes the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); and the physical, chemical, and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, rheumatology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology.\\nIliac vein, common –  In human anatomy, the common iliac veins are formed by the external iliac veins and internal iliac veins. The left and right common iliac veins come together in the abdomen at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, forming the inferior vena cava.  They drain blood from the pelvis and lower limbs. Both common iliac veins are accompanied along their course by common iliac arteries.\\nIliac vein, deep circumflex –\\nIliac vein, external –\\nIliac vein, internal –\\nIndex finger –\\nInfectious disease (medical specialty) –\\nInferior oblique muscle –\\nInferior thyroid artery –\\nInferior vena cava –\\nInfluenza –\\nInspection (medicine) –\\nIntegumentary system –\\nIntensive care medicine –\\nInternal carotid artery –\\nInternal iliac vein –\\nInternal jugular vein –\\nInternal medicine –\\nInternship (medicine) –\\nInterventional cardiology –\\nInterventional radiology –\\nIschium –\\n\\nJ\\nJaundice-  also known as icterus, is a yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels. It is commonly associated with itchiness. The feces may be pale and the urine dark. Jaundice in babies occurs in over half in the first week following birth and does not pose a serious threat in most. If bilirubin levels in babies are very high for too long, a type of brain damage, known as kernicterus, may occur.\\nJaw –  The jaw is any opposable articulated structure at the entrance of the mouth, typically used for grasping and manipulating food. The term jaws is also broadly applied to the whole of the structures constituting the vault of the mouth and serving to open and close it and is part of the body plan of humans and most animals.\\nJejunum- is the second part of the small intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.  Its lining is specialised for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum.\\nJoint –  A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones in the body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.\\nJugular vein –  The jugular veins are veins that take deoxygenated blood from the head back to the heart via the superior vena cava.\\n\\nK\\nKeratogenesis-\\nKeratopathy-\\nKidney –  The kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped organs found in vertebrates. They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about  in length. They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.\\nKnee – In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.\\nKorsakoff syndrome-  (KS) is an amnestic disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency typically associated with prolonged use of alcohol. The syndrome and psychosis are named after Sergei Korsakoff, the Russian neuropsychiatrist who discovered it during the late 19th century.  This neurological disorder is caused by a lack of thiamine in the brain, and is also exacerbated by the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. When Wernicke encephalopathy accompanies Korsakoff syndrome the combination is called Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome; however, a recognized episode of Wernicke encephalopathy is not always obvious.\\n\\nL\\nLarge intestine –The large intestine, also known as the large bowel or colon, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.\\nLaryngeal prominence –  The Adam\\'s apple, or laryngeal prominence, colloquially known as the neck triangle, is the lump or protrusion in the human neck formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx seen especially in males.\\nLaryngeal ventricle –  (also called the ventricle of the larynx, laryngeal sinus, or Morgagni\\'s sinus) is a fusiform fossa, situated between the vestibular and vocal folds on either side, and extending nearly their entire length. There is also a sinus of Morgagni in the pharynx.\\nLigament –  is the fibrous connective tissue that connects bones to other bones.  \\nLips –  are a visible body part at the mouth of many animals, including humans.  Lips are soft, movable, and serve as the opening for food intake and in the articulation of sound and speech.  Human lips are a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.\\nLittle finger –  or pinky finger, also known as the fifth digit, or pinkie, is the most ulnar and smallest finger of the human hand, opposite the thumb, and next to the ring finger.\\nLiver –  is an organ only found in vertebrates which detoxifies various metabolites, synthesizes proteins and produces biochemicals necessary for digestion and growth. In humans, it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, and the production of hormones.\\nLong bone –\\nLumbar vertebrae –\\nLung –\\nLung cancer –\\nLupus erythematosus –\\nLymph –\\nLymphatic system –\\nLymphatic vessel –\\nLymph node –\\nLymphocyte –\\nLymphoma - Cancer of the lymphatic system.\\n\\nM\\nMajor depressive disorder – (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood. Low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause are common symptoms. Those affected may also occasionally have delusions or hallucinations. Some people have periods of depression separated by years, while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depression is more severe and lasts longer than sadness, which is a normal part of life.\\nMale reproductive system –\\nMammary gland –\\nMandible – The mandible, lower jaw or jawbone is the largest, strongest and lowest bone in the human face. It forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place. The mandible sits beneath the maxilla. It is the only movable bone of the skull (discounting the ossicles of the middle ear).\\nMasseter muscle –  In human anatomy, the masseter is one of the muscles of mastication. Found only in mammals, it is particularly powerful in herbivores to facilitate chewing of plant matter. The most obvious muscle of mastication is the masseter muscle, since it is the most superficial and one of the strongest.\\nMaternal-fetal medicine –  (MFM), also known as perinatology, is a branch of medicine that focuses on managing health concerns of the mother and fetus prior to, during, and shortly after pregnancy.\\nMaxilla –  in vertebrates, is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the fusion of two maxillary bones. In humans, the upper jaw includes the hard palate in the front of the mouth. The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis. The mandible is the movable part of the jaw.\\nMCAT – Medical College Admission Test.\\nMedical biology –\\nMedical classification – A medical classification is a list of standardized codes used in the process of medical coding and medical billing.\\nMedical coding – The practice of assigning statistical codes to medical statements, such as those made during a hospital stay. Closely related to medical billing.\\nMedical College Admission Test –   (MCAT), is a computer-based standardized examination for prospective medical students in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Caribbean Islands. It is designed to assess problem solving, critical thinking, written analysis and knowledge of scientific concepts and principles.\\nMedical device –  is any device intended to be used for medical purposes. Medical devices benefit patients by helping health care providers diagnose and treat patients and helping patients overcome sickness or disease, improving their quality of life. Significant potential for hazards are inherent when using a device for medical purposes and thus medical devices must be proved safe and effective with reasonable assurance before regulating governments allow marketing of the device in their country. As a general rule, as the associated risk of the device increases the amount of testing required to establish safety and efficacy also increases. Further, as associated risk increases the potential benefit to the patient must also increase.\\nMedical diagnosis –  (abbreviated Dx or DS) is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person\\'s symptoms and signs. It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.\\nMedical ethics –\\nMedical history –\\nMedical imaging –\\nMedical laboratory –\\nMedical research –\\nMedical school –\\nMedical sign –\\nMedical speciality –\\nMedication –\\nMedulla oblongata –\\nMetacarpal bones –\\nMetatarsal bones –\\nMicrobiology –\\nMiddle finger –\\nMiddle temporal artery –\\nMolecular biology –\\nMouth –\\nMuscle –\\nMuscular system –\\nMusculoskeletal system –\\n\\nN \\nNail –  A nail is a claw-like keratinous plate at the tip of the fingers and toes in most primates. Nails correspond to claws found in other animals. Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough protective protein called alpha-keratin which is found in the hooves, hair, claws and horns of vertebrates.\\nNanobiotechnology –  Nanobiotechnology, bionanotechnology, and nanobiology are terms that refer to the intersection of nanotechnology and biology. Given that the subject is one that has only emerged very recently, bionanotechnology and nanobiotechnology serve as blanket terms for various related technologies.\\nNasal cavity –  is a large, air-filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face. The nasal septum divides the cavity into two cavities, also known as fossae. Each cavity is the continuation of one of the two nostrils. The nasal cavity is the uppermost part of the respiratory system and provides the nasal passage for inhaled air from the nostrils to the nasopharynx and rest of the respiratory tract. The paranasal sinuses surround and drain into the nasal cavity.\\nNasopharynx –  The upper portion of the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate. It includes the space between the internal nares and the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity. The adenoids, also known as the pharyngeal tonsils, are lymphoid tissue structures located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Waldeyer\\'s tonsillar ring is an annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in both the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The nasopharynx is lined by respiratory epithelium that is pseudostratified, columnar, and ciliated.\\nNavel –  The navel (clinically known as the umbilicus, colloquially known as the belly button) is a protruding, flat, or hollowed area on the abdomen at the attachment site of the umbilical cord. All placental mammals have a navel.\\nNephrology –  is a specialty of medicine that concerns with study of  the kidneys, specifically normal kidney function and kidney disease, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation).\\nNerve –  is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibres called axons, in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve transmits electrical impulses and is the basic unit of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon within the nerve is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin.\\nNervous system –  is a highly complex part of an animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events.\\nNeurology –  is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems (and their subdivisions, the autonomic and  somatic nervous systems), including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle. Neurological practice relies heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the nervous system.\\nNeuroscience –  (or neurobiology), is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is a multidisciplinary science that combines physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, mathematical modeling, and psychology to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons and neural circuits.\\nNeurosurgery –  or neurological surgery, is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, surgical treatment, and rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the brain, spinal cord, central and peripheral nervous system, and cerebrovascular system.\\nNose –  The human nose is the most protruding part of the face.  It bears the nostrils and is the first organ of the respiratory system.  It is also the principal organ in the olfactory system.  The shape of the nose is determined by the nasal bones and the nasal cartilages, including the nasal septum which separates the nostrils and divides the nasal cavity into two. On average the nose of a male is larger than that of a female.\\nNuclear medicine –  is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuclear medicine imaging, in a sense, is \"radiology done inside out\" or \"endoradiology\" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology, as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy, but on the function. For such reason, it is called a physiological imaging modality. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.\\nNutrition –  is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.\\n\\nO\\nOblique muscle of auricle –  The oblique muscle of auricle (oblique auricular muscle or Tod muscle) is an intrinsic muscle of the outer ear.  The oblique muscle of auricle is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of a few fibers extending from the upper and back part of the concha to the convexity immediately above it.\\nObstetrics –  is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. As a medical specialty, obstetrics is combined with gynecology under the discipline known as obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), which is a surgical field.\\nObstetrics and gynaecology –  Obstetrics and gynaecology (British English) or obstetrics and gynecology (American English) is the medical specialty that encompasses the two subspecialties of obstetrics (covering pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period) and gynecology (covering the health of the female reproductive system  – vagina, uterus, ovaries, and breasts). It is commonly abbreviated as OB-GYN or OB/GYN in US English, and as obs and gynae or O&G in British English.\\nOccipital bone –   is a cranial dermal bone and the main bone of the occiput (back and lower part of the skull). It is trapezoidal in shape and curved on itself like a shallow dish. The occipital bone overlies the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. At the base of skull in the occipital bone, there is a large oval opening called the foramen magnum, which allows the passage of the spinal cord.\\nOcular surgery –\\nOlfaction –  or the sense of smell, is the process of creating the perception of smell. It occurs when an odor binds to a receptor within the nose, transmitting a signal through the olfactory system. Olfaction has many purposes, including detecting hazards, pheromones, and plays a role in taste.\\nOncology –  is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist. \\nOphthalmology –   is a branch of medicine and surgery which deals with the diagnosis and treatment of eye disorders. An ophthalmologist is a specialist in ophthalmology. The credentials include a degree in medicine, followed by additional four to five years of ophthalmology residency training. Ophthalmology residency training programs may require a one-year pre-residency training in internal medicine, pediatrics, or general surgery. Additional specialty training (or fellowship) may be sought in a particular aspect of eye pathology. Ophthalmologists are allowed to use medications to treat eye diseases,  implement laser therapy, and perform surgery when needed. Ophthalmologists may participate in academic research on the diagnosis and treatment for eye disorders.\\nOptometry –  is a health care profession that involves examining the eyes and applicable visual systems for defects or abnormalities as well as prescribing the correction of refractive error with glasses or contact lenses and the treatment of eye diseases.\\nOrgan –  is a group of tissues with similar functions. Plant life and animal life rely on many organs that co-exist in organ systems.\\nOral and maxillofacial surgery –  is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the oral cavity, head and neck, mouth, and jaws, as well as facial cosmetic surgery.\\nOrbicularis oculi muscle –\\nOrbicularis oris muscle –\\nOrthopedic surgery –\\nOssicles –\\nOtitis –\\nOtorhinolaryngology –\\nOvary –\\n\\nP\\nPalate –  is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals. It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. A similar structure is found in crocodilians, but in most other tetrapods, the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separated. The palate is divided into two parts, the anterior, bony hard palate and the posterior, fleshy soft palate (or velum).\\nPalliative care –  (derived from the Latin root palliare, or \"to cloak\") is an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach aimed at optimizing quality of life and mitigating suffering among people with serious, complex illness. Within the published literature, many definitions of palliative care exist; most notably, the World Health Organization describes palliative care as \"an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual.\" In the past, palliative care was a disease specific approach, but today the World Health Organization takes a more broad approach, that the principles of palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and ultimately fatal illness.\\nPalpation –  is the process of using one\\'s hands to check the body, especially while perceiving/diagnosing a disease or illness.\\nPancreas –  is an organ of the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland. The pancreas has both an endocrine and a digestive exocrine function. As an endocrine gland, it functions mostly to regulate blood sugar levels, secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an exocrine gland secreting pancreatic juice into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. This juice contains bicarbonate, which neutralizes acid entering the duodenum from the stomach; and digestive enzymes, which break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food entering the duodenum from the stomach.\\nPapillary - In oncology, papillary refers to neoplasms with projections (\"papillae\", from Latin, \\'nipple\\') that have fibrovascular cores.\\nParasitology –  is the study of parasites, their hosts, and the relationship between them. As a biological discipline, the scope of parasitology is not determined by the organism or environment in question but by their way of life. This means it forms a synthesis of other disciplines, and draws on techniques from fields such as cell biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, genetics, evolution and ecology.\\nParathyroid glands –  are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and other tetrapods. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, located on the back of the thyroid gland in variable locations. The parathyroid gland produces and secretes parathyroid hormone in response to a low blood calcium, which plays a key role in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.\\nParkinson\\'s disease –\\nPatella –\\nPathology –\\nPectineus muscle –\\nPectoralis major muscle –\\nPectoralis minor muscle –\\nPediatrics –\\nPelvis –\\nPenis –\\nPercussion (medicine) –\\nPeripheral nervous system –\\nPeripheral vision –\\nPhalanx bone –\\nPharmacology –\\nPharynx –\\nPhysician –\\nPhysical examination –\\nPhysiology –\\nPineal gland –\\nPituitary gland –\\nPlacenta –\\nPlastic surgery –\\nPlexus – A branching network of vessels or nerves.\\nPons –\\nPosterior tibial artery –\\nPreventive healthcare –\\nPrognosis –\\nProstate –\\nPsychiatry –\\nPubis –\\nPulmonary artery –\\nPulmonary circulation –\\nPulmonary vein –\\nPulmonology –\\nPulse –\\n\\nQ\\nQuadriplegia –  Tetraplegia, also known as quadriplegia, is paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso; paraplegia is similar but does not affect the arms. The loss is usually sensory and motor, which means that both sensation and control are lost. The paralysis may be flaccid or spastic.\\n\\nR\\nRadial artery –  In human anatomy, the radial artery is the main artery of the lateral aspect of the forearm.\\nRadial nerve –  is a nerve in the human body that supplies the posterior portion of the upper limb. It innervates the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii muscle of the arm, as well as all 12 muscles in the posterior osteofascial compartment of the forearm and the associated joints and overlying skin.  It originates from the brachial plexus, carrying fibers from the ventral roots of spinal nerves C5, C6, C7, C8 & T1.\\nRadiology –  is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases within the body.\\nRadius –  The radius, or radial bone, is one of the two large bones of the forearm, the other being the ulna. It extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna. The ulna is usually slightly longer than the radius, but the radius is thicker. Therefore, the radius is considered to be the larger of the two.  It is a long bone, prism-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally.\\nRectum –  is the final straight portion of the large intestine in humans and some other mammals, and the gut in others. The adult human rectum is about  long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction, the end of the sigmoid colon, at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal which is about  long, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge. The word rectum comes from the Latin rectum intestinum, meaning straight intestine.\\nRectus abdominis muscle –  also known as the abdominal muscle, is a paired muscle running vertically on each side of the anterior wall of the human abdomen, as well as that of some other mammals. There are two parallel muscles, separated by a midline band of connective tissue called the linea alba. It extends from the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle inferiorly, to the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of ribs V to VII superiorly.  The proximal attachments are the pubic crest and the pubic symphysis.  It attaches distally at the costal cartilages of ribs 5-7 and the xiphoid process of the sternum.\\nRectus femoris muscle –  is one of the four quadriceps muscles of the human body. The others are the vastus medialis, the vastus intermedius (deep to the rectus femoris), and the vastus lateralis. All four parts of the quadriceps muscle attach to the patella (knee cap) by the quadriceps tendon.  The rectus femoris is situated in the middle of the front of the thigh; it is fusiform in shape, and its superficial fibers are arranged in a bipenniform manner, the deep fibers running straight () down to the deep aponeurosis. Its functions are to flex the thigh at the hip joint and to extend the leg at the knee joint.\\nRed blood cell – The most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate\\'s principal means of delivering oxygen to the body tissues — via blood flow through the circulatory system. Red blood cells take up oxygen in the lungs and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body\\'s capillaries.\\nRenal artery –\\nRenal vein –\\nReproductive system –\\nResidency (medicine) –\\nRespiratory system –\\nRheumatology –\\nRib cage –\\nRing finger –\\n\\nS\\nSacrum –  The sacrum (plural: sacra or sacrums), in human anatomy, is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine that forms by the fusing of sacral vertebrae S1S5 between 18 and 30years of age.\\nSalivary gland –  The salivary glands in mammals are exocrine glands that produce saliva through a system of ducts. Humans have three paired major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), a pair of seromucous tubarial glands (discovered in 2020) as well as hundreds of minor salivary glands. Salivary glands can be classified as serous, mucous or seromucous (mixed).\\nSaphenous nerve –  (long or internal saphenous nerve) is the largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve.  It is a strictly sensory nerve, and has no motor function.\\nSaphenous vein, great –\\nSaphenous vein, small –\\nSartorius muscle –\\nScalp –\\nScapula –\\nSciatic nerve –\\nScrotum –\\nSebaceous gland –\\nSeminal vesicle –\\nSensory nervous system –\\nSensory processing –\\nSerratus anterior muscle –\\nSerratus posterior inferior muscle –\\nSerratus posterior superior muscle –\\nSkeletal muscle –\\nSkin –\\nSkull –\\nSmall intestine –\\nSmall saphenous vein –\\nSmooth muscle tissue –\\nSpecial senses –\\nSpecialty (medicine) –\\nSpinal cord –\\nSpinal nerve –\\nSole –\\nSoleus muscle –\\nSpleen –\\nSports medicine –\\nSternohyoid muscle –\\nSternum –\\nStomach –\\nStriated muscle tissue –\\nSubclavian artery –\\nSubcutaneous tissue –\\nSuperficial temporal artery –\\nSuperior oblique muscle –\\nSuperior thyroid artery –\\nSuperior vena cava –\\nSurgery –\\nSweat gland –\\nSymptom –\\nSynovial bursa –\\nSynovial joint –\\nSynovial membrane –\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus –\\nSystems biology –\\n\\nT\\nTarsus –  In the human body, the tarsus is a cluster of seven articulating bones in each foot situated between the lower end of the tibia and the fibula of the lower leg and the metatarsus. It is made up of the midfoot (cuboid, medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform, and navicular) and hindfoot (talus and calcaneus).\\nTaste –  The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor). Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.\\nTeeth –\\nTemple –\\nTemporal arteries, deep –\\nTemporal artery, middle –\\nTemporal artery, superficial –\\nTemporal muscle –\\nTendon –\\nTensor fasciae latae muscle –\\nTesticle –\\nThigh –\\nThoracic diaphragm –\\nThorax –\\nThroat –\\nThumb –\\nThymus –\\nThyroid –\\nThyroid artery, inferior –\\nThyroid artery, superior –\\nThyroid ima artery –\\nTibia –\\nTibialis anterior muscle –\\nTibialis posterior muscle –\\nTissue –\\nToe –\\nToll-like receptor –\\nTongue –\\nToxicology –\\nTrachea –\\nTrapezius muscle –\\nTriceps brachii muscle –\\n\\nU\\nUlna –  is a long bone found in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the smallest finger, and when in anatomical position, is found on the medial side of the forearm. It runs parallel to the radius, the other long bone in the forearm. The ulna is usually slightly longer than the radius, but the radius is thicker. Therefore, the radius is considered to be the larger of the two.\\nUlnar artery –  is the main blood vessel, with oxygenated blood, of the medial aspects of the forearm.  It arises from the brachial artery and terminates in the superficial palmar arch, which joins with the superficial branch of the radial artery.  It is palpable on the anterior and medial aspect of the wrist.\\nUlnar nerve –  In human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna bone. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common. This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds.\\nUreter –  The ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the human adult, the ureters are usually  long and around  in diameter. The ureter is lined by urothelial cells, a type of transitional epithelium, and has an additional smooth muscle layer in third closest to the bladder that assists with peristalsis.\\nUrethra –  The urethra is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the urinary meatus for the removal of urine from the body of both females and males. In human females and other primates, the urethra connects to the urinary meatus above the vagina, whereas in marsupials, the female\\'s urethra empties into the urogenital sinus.  Females use their urethra only for urinating, but males use their urethra for both urination and ejaculation. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination. The internal sphincter, formed by the involuntary smooth muscles lining the bladder neck and urethra, receives its nerve supply by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. The internal sphincter is present both in males and females.\\nUrinary bladder –  The urinary bladder, or simply bladder, is a hollow muscular organ in humans and other vertebrates that stores urine from the kidneys before disposal by urination.  In the human the bladder is a hollow muscular, and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. The typical human bladder will hold between 300 and  (10.14 and ) before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold considerably more.\\nUrinary system –  The urinary system, also known as the renal system or urinary tract, consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and the urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body\\'s drainage system for the eventual removal of urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons. Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination (voiding). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.\\nUrology –  also known as genitourinary surgery, is the branch of medicine that focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the male and female urinary-tract system and the male reproductive organs. Organs under the domain of urology include the kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and the male reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, and penis).\\nUterus –  The uterus  or womb is a major female hormone-responsive secondary sex organ of the reproductive system in humans and most other mammals. In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the upper end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. In the human embryo, the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.\\n\\nV\\nVaccine –  is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body\\'s immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future. Vaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer, which are being investigated).\\nVagina –  In mammals, the vagina is the elastic, muscular part of the female genital tract. In humans, it extends from the vulva to the cervix. The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth.  It also channels menstrual flow (menses), which occurs in humans and closely related primates as part of the monthly menstrual cycle.\\nVas deferens –  also called ductus deferens, is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates; these ducts transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation of ejaculation.  It is a partially coiled tube which exits the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.\\nVastus intermedius muscle –  arises from the front and lateral surfaces of the body of the femur in its upper two-thirds, sitting under the rectus femoris muscle and from the lower part of the lateral intermuscular septum. Its fibers end in a superficial aponeurosis, which forms the deep part of the quadriceps femoris tendon.\\nVastus lateralis muscle –\\nVastus medialis –\\nVein –\\nVena cava, inferior –\\nVena cava, superior –\\nVentricle –\\nVentricle system –\\nVenule –\\nVertebral column –\\nVirology – is the study of viral – submicroscopic, parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat – and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine.\\nVisual acuity –  (VA), commonly refers to the clarity of vision, but technically rates an examinee\\'s ability to recognize small details with precision. Visual acuity is dependent on optical and neural factors, i.e., (1) the sharpness of the retinal image within the eye, (2) the health and functioning of the retina, and (3) the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain.\\nVisual cortex –  The visual cortex of the brain is the area of the cerebral cortex that processes visual information. It is located in the occipital lobe. Sensory input originating from the eyes travels through the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then reaches the visual cortex. The area of the visual cortex that receives the sensory input from the lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary visual cortex, also known as visual area 1 (V1), Brodmann area 17, or the striate cortex. The extrastriate areas consist of visual areas 2, 3, 4, and 5 (also known as V2, V3, V4, and V5, or Brodmann area 18 and all Brodmann area 19).\\nVisual field test –  is an eye examination that can detect dysfunction in central and peripheral vision which may be caused by various medical conditions such as glaucoma, stroke, pituitary disease, brain tumours or other neurological deficits. Visual field testing can be performed clinically by keeping the subject\\'s gaze fixed while presenting objects at various places within their visual field.  Simple manual equipment can be used such as in the tangent screen test or the Amsler grid.  When dedicated machinery is used it is called a perimeter.\\nVisual perception –  is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment. This is different from visual acuity, which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example \"20/20 vision\"). A person can have problems with visual perceptual processing even if they have 20/20 vision.\\nVital signs –  (also known as vitals) are a group of the four to six most important medical signs that indicate the status of the body\\'s vital (life-sustaining) functions. These measurements are taken to help assess the general physical health of a person, give clues to possible diseases, and show progress toward recovery. The normal ranges for a person\\'s vital signs vary with age, weight, gender, and overall health.  There are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate), often notated as BT, BP, HR, and RR. However, depending on the clinical setting, the vital signs may include other measurements called the \"fifth vital sign\" or \"sixth vital sign\". Vital signs are recorded using the LOINC internationally accepted standard coding system.\\nVitamin D –  is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and many other biological effects.  In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).\\nVitrectomy –  is a surgery to remove some or all of the vitreous humor from the eye.  Anterior vitrectomy entails removing small portions of the vitreous humor from the front structures of the eye—often because these are tangled in an intraocular lens or other structures.  Pars plana vitrectomy is a general term for a group of operations accomplished in the deeper part of the eye, all of which involve removing some or all of the vitreous humor—the eye\\'s clear internal jelly.\\nVitreous body –\\nVulva –\\n\\nW\\nWaist –  is the part of the abdomen between the rib cage and hips. On people with slim bodies, the waist is the narrowest part of the torso.  The waistline refers to the horizontal line where the waist is narrowest, or to the general appearance of the waist.\\nWart –  Warts are typically small, rough, hard growths that are similar in color to the rest of the skin. They typically do not result in other symptoms, except when on the bottom of the feet, where they may be painful. While they usually occur on the hands and feet, they can also affect other locations. One or many warts may appear. They are not cancerous.\\nWeber test –  is a screening test for hearing performed with a tuning fork. It can detect unilateral (one-sided) conductive hearing loss (middle ear hearing loss) and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (inner ear hearing loss). The test is named after Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878).  Conductive hearing ability is mediated by the middle ear composed of the ossicles: the malleus, the incus, and the stapes.  Sensorineural hearing ability is mediated by the inner ear composed of the cochlea with its internal basilar membrane and attached cochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII).  The outer ear consisting of the pinna, ear canal, and ear drum or tympanic membrane transmits sounds to the middle ear but does not contribute to the conduction or sensorineural hearing ability save for hearing transmissions limited by cerumen impaction (wax collection in the ear canal).  The Weber test has had its value as a screening test questioned in the literature.\\nWernicke–Korsakoff syndrome –  (WKS) is the combined presence of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. Due to the close relationship between these two disorders, people with either are usually diagnosed with WKS as a single syndrome. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory.\\nWernicke\\'s area –  also called Wernicke\\'s speech area, is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech, the other being Broca\\'s area. It is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language, in contrast to Broca\\'s area, which is involved in the production of language. It is traditionally thought to reside in Brodmann area 22, which is located in the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals and 60% of left-handed individuals.\\nWhiplash –  is a non-medical term describing a range of injuries to the neck caused by or related to a sudden distortion of the neck associated with extension, although the exact injury mechanisms remain unknown. The term \"whiplash\" is a colloquialism. \"Cervical acceleration–deceleration\" (CAD) describes the mechanism of the injury, while the term \"whiplash associated disorders\" (WAD) describes the injury sequelae and symptoms.\\nWhite blood cell –  White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.\\nWhite matter –  refers to areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that are mainly made up of myelinated axons, also called tracts. Long thought to be passive tissue, white matter affects learning and brain functions, modulating the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions.\\nWorking memory –  is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that can hold information temporarily. Working memory is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. Working memory is a theoretical concept central to cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.\\nWrist –  In human anatomy, the wrist is variously defined as 1) the carpus or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand; (2) the wrist joint or radiocarpal joint, the joint between the radius and the carpus and; (3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the metacarpus or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as wrist joints.  This region also includes the carpal tunnel, the anatomical snuff box, bracelet lines, the flexor retinaculum, and the extensor retinaculum.  As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered fractures to the wrist.\\n\\nX\\nXanthoma –  A xanthoma (pl. xanthomas or xanthomata) (condition: xanthomatosis), , is a deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material that can appear anywhere in the body in various disease states. They are cutaneous manifestations of lipidosis in which lipids accumulate in large foam cells within the skin. They are associated with hyperlipidemias, both primary and secondary types.\\n\\nY\\n\\nYaws –  is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue. The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, 2 to 5 centimeters in diameter. The center may break open and form an ulcer. This initial skin lesion typically heals after three to six months. After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin lesions may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen. After five years or more large areas of skin may die, leaving a scar.\\nYellow fever –  is a viral disease of typically short duration. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In about 15% of people, within a day of improving the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is increased.\\n\\nZ\\nZellweger spectrum disorders –  are a group of rare disorders that create the same disease process. The subdivisions of this spectrum are hyperpipecolic acidemia, Infantile Refsum disease, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and Zellweger syndrome. It can also be referred to as Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum, NALD, Cerebrohepatorenal Syndrome, and ZSS. It can affect many body organs, including the kidneys, eyes, and hearing. It is named after Hans Zellweger.\\nZika virus –  (ZIKV)  (pronounced  or ) is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. It is spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Its name comes from the Ziika Forest of Uganda, where the virus was first isolated in 1947. Zika virus shares a genus with the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Since the 1950s, it has been known to occur within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. From 2007 to , the virus spread eastward, across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas, leading to the 2015–2016 Zika virus epidemic.\\nZoonosis –  A zoonosis (plural zoonoses, or zoonotic diseases) is an infectious disease caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from a non-human animal (usually a vertebrate) to a human. Typically, the first infected human transmits the infectious agent to at least one other human, who, in turn, infects others.\\nZygomatic bone –  In the human skull, the zygomatic bone (cheekbone or malar bone) is a paired irregular bone which articulates with the maxilla, the temporal bone, the sphenoid bone and the frontal bone. It is situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forms the prominence of the cheek, part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, and parts of the temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. It presents a malar and a temporal surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal), and four borders.\\n\\nSee also \\nMedicine\\nOutline of medicine\\nList of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes\\nList of bones of the human skeleton\\nList of nerves of the human body\\nList of skeletal muscles of the human body\\nAnatomical terms of location\\nList of diseases\\nHistory of medicine\\nMedical College Admission Test\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nMedicine\\nMedicine',\n",
       "       'The EmDrive is a concept for a thruster for spacecraft, first written about in 2001. It is purported to generate thrust by reflecting microwaves internally in the device, in a way that would violate the law of conservation of momentum and other laws of physics. The concept has been referred to at times as a resonant cavity thruster or as the Impossible Drive. \\n\\nThere is no official design for this device. Neither of the people who claim to have invented it have committed to an explanation for how it could operate as a thruster or what elements define it, making it hard to say definitively whether a given object is an example of such a device. However, prototypes based on its public descriptions have been constructed and tested.  \\n\\nIn 2016, Harold White\\'s group at NASA reported observing a small apparent thrust from one such test, a result not since replicated, and subsequent studies have indicated that the thrust observed was measurement error caused by interactions with the Earth\\'s magnetic field or by thermal gradients. No other published experiment has measured apparent thrust greater than the experiment\\'s margin of error. \\n\\nIn March 2021, physicists at the Dresden University of Technology published three papers claiming that all results showing thrust were false positives, explained by outside forces: \\n\\nWhen power flows into the EmDrive, the engine warms up. This also causes the fastening elements on the scale to warp, causing the scale to move to a new zero point. We were able to prevent that in an improved structure. Our measurements refute all EmDrive claims by at least 3 orders of magnitude.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Dresden University scientists were able to replicate apparent thrusts similar to those measured by the NASA team, and then make them disappear again when measured using point suspension.\\n\\nHistory and controversy \\n\\nRocket engines operate by expelling propellant, which acts as a reaction mass and which produces thrust per Newton’s third law of motion. In the 1960s, extensive research was conducted on two designs which emit high-velocity ionized gases in similar ways: ion thrusters that convert propellant to ions and accelerate and eject them via electric potentials, and plasma thrusters that convert propellant to plasma ions and accelerate and eject them via plasma currents. All designs for electromagnetic propulsion operate on the principle of reaction mass.    \\n\\nA drive which does not expel propellant in order to produce a reaction force, providing thrust while being a closed system with no external interaction, would be a reactionless drive. Such a drive would violate the conservation of momentum and Newton\\'s third law, leading many physicists to consider the idea pseudoscience.\\n\\nThe original proposal for an RF resonant cavity thruster came from Roger Shawyer in 2001. He proposed a design with a conical cavity, which he called \"EmDrive\". He claimed that it produced thrust in the direction of the base of the cavity. Guido Fetta later built a \"Cannae Drive\", based on Shawyer\\'s concept, using a pillbox-shaped cavity.\\nSince 2008, a few physicists have tested their own models, trying to reproduce the results claimed by Shawyer and Fetta. Juan Yang at Xi\\'an\\'s Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) was unable to reproducibly measure thrust from their models, over the course of 4 years. In 2016, Harold White\\'s group at NASA\\'s Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory reported in the Journal of Propulsion and Power that a test of their own model had observed a small thrust. In December 2016, Yue Chen of the communication satellite division of the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), said his team had tested prototypes, and was carrying out in-orbit verification to see if they could observe thrust. In September 2017, Chen talked about this CAST project again in an interview on CCTV.\\n\\nMedia coverage and responses \\nMedia coverage of experiments using these designs has been controversial and polarized. The EmDrive first drew attention, both credulous and dismissive, when New Scientist wrote about it as an \"impossible\" drive in 2006. Media outlets were later criticized for misleading claims that a resonant cavity thruster had been \"validated by NASA\" following White\\'s first tentative test reports in 2014. Scientists have continued to note the lack of unbiased coverage.\\n\\nIn 2006, responding to the New Scientist piece, mathematical physicist John C. Baez at the University of California, Riverside, and Australian science-fiction writer Greg Egan, said the positive results reported by Shawyer were likely misinterpretations of experimental errors.\\n\\nIn 2014, White\\'s conference paper suggested that resonant cavity thrusters could work by transferring momentum to the \"quantum vacuum virtual plasma,\" a new term he coined. Baez and Carroll criticized this explanation, because in the standard description of vacuum fluctuations, virtual particles do not behave as a plasma; Carroll also noted that the quantum vacuum has no \"rest frame\", providing nothing to push against, so it can\\'t be used for propulsion. In the same way, physicists James F. Woodward and Heidi Fearn published two papers showing that electron-positron virtual pairs of the quantum vacuum, discussed by White as a potential virtual plasma propellant, could not account for thrust in any isolated, closed electromagnetic system such as a quantum vacuum thruster.\\n\\nIn 2015, physicists Eric W. Davis at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin and Sean M. Carroll at the California Institute of Technology concluded that the thrust measurements reported in papers by both Tajmar and White were indicative of thermal effect errors.\\n\\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Institute of Aerospace Engineering at Technische Universität Dresden, Germany, concluded that the dominant effect underlying the apparent thrust could be clearly identified as an artifact caused by Earth\\'s magnetic field interacting with power cables in the chamber, a result that other experts agree with.\\n\\nIn March 2021, Tajmar\\'s group published a definitive analysis of their own past experiments and those of others, showing that all were explained by and could be reproduced via outside forces, and refuting all EmDrive claims.When power flows into the EmDrive, the engine warms up. This also causes the fastening elements on the scale to warp, causing the scale to move to a new zero point. We were able to prevent that in an improved structure. Our measurements refute all EmDrive claims by at least 3 orders of magnitude.\\n\\nDesigns and prototypes\\n\\nEmDrive \\nIn 2001, Shawyer founded Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd, to work on the EmDrive, which he said used a resonant cavity to produce thrust without propellant. The company was backed by a SMART award grant from the UK Department of Trade and Industry. In December 2002, he loosely described a  prototype which he alleged had produced a thrust of  powered by an 850 W cavity magnetron. The device could operate for only a few dozen seconds before the magnetron failed from overheating. Details were never published or replicated.\\n\\nSecond device and New Scientist article \\nIn October 2006, Shawyer conducted tests on a new water-cooled prototype and said it had increased thrust. He reported plans to have the device ready to use in space by May 2009 and to make the resonant cavity a superconductor, neither of which materialized.\\n\\nNew Scientist magazine featured the EmDrive on the cover of 8 September 2006 issue. The article portrayed the device as plausible and emphasized the arguments of those who held that point of view. Science fiction author Greg Egan distributed a public letter stating that \"a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers\" made the magazine\\'s coverage unreliable, sufficient \"to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science\". Especially, Egan said he was \"gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy\" in the magazine\\'s coverage, alleging that it used \"meaningless double-talk\" to obfuscate the problem of conservation of momentum. The letter was endorsed by mathematical physicist John C. Baez and posted on his blog. New Scientist editor Jeremy Webb responded to critics: New Scientist also published a letter from the former technical director of EADS Astrium:   A letter from physicist Paul Friedlander:\\n\\nLater work \\nIn 2007, the UK Department of Trade and Industry granted SPR an export license to Boeing in the US. According to Shawyer, in December 2008 he was invited to present on the EmDrive, and in 2009 Boeing expressed interest in it, at which point he stated that SPR built a thruster which produced 18 grams of thrust, and sent it to Boeing. Boeing did not license the technology and communication stopped. In 2012, a Boeing representative confirmed that Boeing Phantom Works used to explore exotic forms of space propulsion, including Shawyer\\'s drive, but such work later ceased.  They confirmed that \"Phantom Works is not working with Mr. Shawyer,\" nor pursuing those explorations.\\n\\nIn 2013 and 2014, Shawyer presented ideas for \\'second-generation\\' EmDrive designs and applications at the annual International Astronautical Congress. A paper based on his presentation was published in Acta Astronautica in 2015. It describes a model for a superconducting resonant cavity and three models for thrusters with multiple cavities.\\n\\nIn 2016, Shawyer filed further patents and launched a new company, Universal Propulsion Ltd., as a joint venture with Gilo Industries Group, a small UK aerospace company.\\n\\nCannae and other drives \\nThe Cannae Drive (formerly Q-drive), is another implementation of this idea, with a relatively flat cavity rather than a truncated cone. It was designed by Fetta in 2006 and promoted within the US through his company, Cannae LLC, since 2011. In 2016, Fetta announced plans to eventually launch a CubeSat satellite containing a version of the Cannae Drive, which would run for 6 months to observe how it functions in space. No followup was published.\\n\\nIn China, researchers working under Yang at NWPU built a resonant cavity thruster in 2008, publishing a report in their university\\'s journal on the theory behind such devices. In 2012 they measured thrust from their prototype, however, in 2014 they found this had been an experimental error. A second, improved prototype did not produce any measured thrust.\\n\\nAt the China Academy of Space Technology, Yue Chen filed several patent applications in 2016 describing various RF resonant cavity thruster designs. These included a method for stacking several short resonant cavities to improve thrust, and a design with a cavity that was a semicylinder instead of a frustum. That December, Chen announced that CAST was conducting tests on a resonant cavity thruster in orbit, without specifying what design was used. In an interview on CCTV in September 2017, Chen Yue showed some testing of a flat cylindrical device. corresponding to the patent describing stacked short cavities with internal diaphragms.\\n\\nTheoretical inconsistencies \\nThe proposed theory for how the EmDrive works violates the conservation of momentum, which states any interaction cannot have a net force; a consequence of the conservation of momentum is Newton\\'s third law, where for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The conservation of momentum is a symmetry of nature.\\n\\nAn often cited example of apparent nonconservation of momentum is the Casimir effect; in the standard case where two parallel plates are attracted to each other. However the plates move in opposite directions, so no net momentum is extracted from the vacuum and, moreover, energy must be put into the system to take the plates apart again.\\n\\nAssuming homogeneous electric and magnetic fields, it is impossible for the EmDrive, or any other device, to extract a net momentum transfer from either a classical or quantum vacuum.\\nExtraction of a net momentum \"from nothing\"\\nhas been postulated in an inhomogeneous vacuum, but this remains highly controversial as it will violate Lorentz invariance.\\n\\nBoth Harold White\\'s\\nand Mike McCulloch\\'s theories of how the EmDrive could work rely on these asymmetric or dynamical Casimir effects. However, if these vacuum forces are present, they are expected to be exceptionally tiny based on our current understanding, too small to explain the level of observed thrust.\\nIn the event that observed thrust is not due to experimental error, a positive result could indicate new physics.\\n\\nTests and experiments\\n\\nTests by inventors \\nIn 2004, Shawyer claimed to have received seven independent positive reviews from experts at BAE Systems, EADS Astrium, Siemens and the IEE. However no independent expert published a positive review, and at least one directly disputed Shawyer\\'s claim. In a letter to New Scientist, the then-technical director of EADS Astrium (Shawyer\\'s former employer) denied this, stating: \\n\\nIn 2011, Fetta tested a superconducting version of the Cannae drive. The RF resonant cavity was suspended inside a liquid helium-filled dewar. The weight of the cavity was monitored by load cells. Fetta theorized that when the device was activated and produced upward thrust, the load cells would detect the thrust as a change in weight. According to Fetta, when pulses of RF power were sent into the resonant cavity, there was a reduction in compressive force on the load cells that could indicate thrust.\\n\\nNone of these results were published in the scientific literature, replicated by independent researchers, or replicated consistently by the inventors. In a few cases details were posted for a time on the inventors\\' websites, but no such documents remain online as of 2019.\\n\\nIn 2015, Shawyer published an article in Acta Astronautica, summarising existing tests on the EmDrive. Of seven tests, four produced a measured force in the intended direction and three produced thrust in the opposite direction. Furthermore, in one test, thrust could be produced in either direction by varying the spring constants in the measuring apparatus.\\n\\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University \\nIn 2008, a team of Chinese researchers led by Juan Yang (杨涓), professor of propulsion theory and engineering of aeronautics and astronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in Xi\\'an, China, said that they had developed a valid electro-magnetic theory behind a microwave resonant cavity thruster. A demonstration version of the drive was built and tested with different cavity shapes and at higher power levels in 2010. Using an aerospace engine test stand usually used to precisely test spacecraft engines like ion drives, they reported a maximum thrust of 720\\xa0mN at 2,500\\xa0W of input power. Yang noted that her results were tentative, and said she \"[was] not able to discuss her work until more results are published\".  \\n\\nIn a 2014 follow-up experiment (published in 2016), Yang could not reproduce the 2010 observation and suggested it was due to experimental error. They had refined their experimental setup, using a three-wire torsion pendulum to measure thrust, and tested two different power setups.  They concluded that they were unable to measure significant thrust; that \"thrust\" measured when using external power sources (as in their 2010 experiment) could be noise; and that it was important to use self-contained power systems for these experiments, and more sensitive pendulums with lower torsional stiffness.\\n\\nNASA Eagleworks \\n\\nSince 2011, White had a team at NASA known as the Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory, or Eagleworks Laboratories, devoted to studying exotic propulsion concepts. The group investigated ideas for a wide range of untested and fringe proposals, including Alcubierre drives, drives that interact with the quantum vacuum, and RF resonant cavity thrusters. In 2014, the group began testing resonant cavity thrusters, and in November 2016 they published a peer-reviewed paper on this work, in the Journal of Propulsion and Power.\\n\\nEmDrive and tapered cavities \\n\\nIn July 2014, White reported tentative positive results for evaluating a tapered RF resonant cavity. Their first tests of this tapered cavity were conducted at very low power (2% of Shawyer\\'s 2002 experiment). A net mean thrust over five runs was measured at 91.2\\xa0µN at 17\\xa0W of input power. The experiment was criticized for its small data set and for not having been conducted in vacuum, to eliminate thermal air currents.\\n\\nThe group announced a plan to upgrade their equipment to higher power levels, and to use a test framework subject to independent verification and validation at Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. This did not happen.\\n\\nThey later conducted experiments in vacuum at 40-80W of input power. In 2016 they published the results in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\\'s peer-reviewed Journal of Propulsion and Power, under the title \"Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum\". The study said that the system was \"consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2±0.1mN/kW\", but also enumerated many potential sources of error.  This experiment was again criticized for its small dataset and missing details about the experimental setup, which was again not independently validated.\\n\\nDresden University of Technology \\n\\nIn July 2015, an aerospace research group at the Dresden University of Technology (TUD) under Martin Tajmar reported results for an evaluation of an RF resonant tapered cavity similar to the EmDrive. Testing was performed first on a knife-edge beam balance able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1\\xa0mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at .\\n\\nThey used a conventional ISM band 2.45\\xa0GHz 700 W oven magnetron, and a small cavity with a low Q factor (20 in vacuum tests).  They observed small positive thrusts in the positive direction and negative thrusts in the negative direction, of about 20\\xa0µN in a hard vacuum.  However, when they rotated the cavity upwards as a \"null\" configuration, they observed an anomalous thrust of hundreds of micronewtons, much larger than the expected result of zero thrust.  This indicated a strong source of noise which they could not identify. This led them to conclude that they could not confirm or refute claims about the device.\\n\\nIn 2018, they published results from an improved test rig, which showed that their measured thrust had been a result of experimental error from insufficiently shielded components interacting with the Earth\\'s magnetic field. In new experiments, they measured thrust values consistent with previous experiments and again measured thrust perpendicular to the expected direction when the thruster was rotated by 90°. Moreover, they did not measure a reduction in thrust when an attenuator was used to reduce the power that actually entered the resonant cavity by a factor of 10,000, which they said \"clearly indicates that the \"thrust\" is not coming from the EMDrive but from some electromagnetic interaction.\" They concluded that \"magnetic interaction from not sufficiently shielded cables or thrusters are a major factor that needs to be taken into account for proper μN thrust measurements for these type of devices,\" and they planned on conducting future tests at higher power and at different frequencies, and with improved shielding and cavity geometry.\\n\\nIn 2021, they revisited these experiments again and ran more precise tests. They reported with high confidence that the forces previously measured could be completely explained by experimental error, and that there was no evidence for any measurable thrust once these errors were taken into account. They were able to run the experiment and show no thrust in any direction, and to reintroduce the previous sources of experimental error to replicate the earlier results.  They also published two other papers, showing similar negative results for the laser-based LemDrive variant and Woodward\\'s Mach-Effect Thruster.\\n\\nTests in space \\nIn August 2016, Cannae announced plans to launch its thruster on a 6U cubesat which they would run for 6 months to observe how it functions in space. Cannae has formed a company called Theseus for the venture and partnered with LAI International and SpaceQuest Ltd. to launch the satellite. No launch date has yet been announced.\\n\\nIn December 2016, Yue Chen told a reporter at China\\'s Science and Technology Daily that his team was testing an EmDrive in orbit, and had been funding research in the area for five years. Chen noted that their prototype\\'s thrust was at the \"micronewton to millinewton level\", which would have to be scaled up to at least 100–1000 millinewtons for a chance of conclusive experimental results. Despite this, he said his goal was to validate the drive if possible, and make such technology available for satellite engineering \"as quickly as possible\".\\n\\nExperimental errors \\nExperimental errors in the testing of the prototypes generally fall into four categories\\n\\n Measurement errors. Most theoretical scientists who have looked at the EmDrive believe this to be the likely case.\\n Electromagnetic effects.\\n Exhaust not being measured or taken into account.\\n Speculation that our current understanding of the laws of physics are completely wrong.\\n\\nMeasurement errors \\n\\nThe simplest and most likely explanation is that any thrust detected is due to experimental error or noise. In all of the experiments set up, a very large amount of energy goes into generating a tiny amount of thrust. When attempting to measure a small signal superimposed on a large signal, the noise from the large signal can obscure the small signal and give incorrect results. The strongest early result, from Yang\\'s group in China, was later reported to be caused by an experimental error.\\n\\nShift in center of gravity due to thermal effects \\n\\nThe largest error source is believed to come from the thermal expansion of the thruster\\'s heat sink; as it expands this would lead to a change in the centre of gravity causing the resonant cavity to move. White\\'s team attempted to model the thermal effect on the overall displacement by using a superposition of the displacements caused by \"thermal effects\" and \"impulsive thrust\" with White saying \"That was the thing we worked the hardest to understand and put in a box\". Despite these efforts, White\\'s team were unable to fully account for the thermal expansion. In an interview with Aerospace America, White comments that \"although maybe we put a little bit of a pencil mark through [thermal errors]... they are certainly not black-Sharpie-crossed-out.\"\\n\\nTheir method of accounting for thermal effects has been criticized by Millis and Davies, who highlight that there is a lack of both mathematical and empirical detail to justify the assumptions made about those effects.  For example, they do not provide data on temperature measurement over time compared to device displacement. The paper includes a graphical chart, but it is based on a priori assumptions about what the shapes of the \"impulsive thrust\" and \"thermal effects\" should be, and how those signals will superimpose. The model further assumes all noise to be thermal and does not include other effects such as interaction with the chamber wall, power lead forces, and tilting. Because the Eagleworks paper has no explicit model for thrust to compare with the observations, it is ultimately subjective, and its data can be interpreted in more than one way. The Eagleworks test, therefore, does not conclusively show a thrust effect, but cannot rule it out either.\\n\\nWhite suggested future experiments could run on a Cavendish balance. In such a setup, the thruster could rotate out to much larger angular displacements, letting a thrust (if present) dominate any possible thermal effects. Testing a device in space would also eliminate the center-of-gravity issue. Tajmar\\'s team later used such a setup to show that past results had all been artefacts of thermal effects.\\n\\nElectromagnetic interaction with the vacuum chamber\\'s wall \\nAnother source of error could have arisen from electromagnetic interaction with the walls of the vacuum chamber. White argued that any wall interaction could only be the result of a well-formed resonance coupling between the device and wall and that the high frequency used imply the chances of this would be highly dependent on the device\\'s geometry. As components get warmer due to thermal expansion, the device\\'s geometry changes, shifting the resonance of the cavity. In order to counter this effect and keep the system in optimal resonance conditions, White used a phase-locked loop system (PLL). Their analysis assumed that using a PLL ruled out significant electromagnetic interaction with the wall.\\n\\nLorentz force from power leads \\nAnother potential source of error was a Lorentz force arising from power leads. Many previous experiments used cups with Galinstan metal alloy, which is liquid at room temperature, to supply electrical power to the device in lieu of solid wires. Martin Tajmar and his graduate student Fiedler characterized and attempted to quantify possible sources of error in their experiment at Dresden University of Technology. They ran multiple tests on their experimental setup, including measurements of the force along different axes with respect to the power supply current. While eliminating or accounting for many other sources of error in previous experiments, such as replacing a magnetic damping mechanism with an oil damper, less efficient but significantly less interacting with electromagnetic field, the study remained inconclusive as to the effects of electromagnetic interaction with the apparatus\\' power feed, at the same time noting it as possibly the most significant source of noise. White\\'s power setup may have been different, but their paper does not state if the connections are all coaxially aligned with the stand\\'s rotation axis, which would be required to minimize errors from Lorentz forces, and it gives no data from equivalent tests with power into a dummy load so these influences can be compared with those seen in the Tajmar-Fiedler run.\\n\\nSpeculation regarding new physical laws \\n\\nWhite\\'s 2016 paper went through about a year of peer review involving five referees. Peer review does not mean the results or observations are true, only that the referees looked at the experiment, results and interpretation and found it to be sound and sensible. Brice Cassenti, a professor at the University of Connecticut and an expert in advanced propulsion, spoke to one of the referees, and reported the referee did not believe the results point to any new physics, but thought the results were puzzling enough to publish. Cassenti believes there is a mundane explanation for the results, but the probability of the results being valid is slim but not zero.\\n\\nMarc Millis and Eric Davies who ran NASA\\'s previous advanced propulsion project, the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program have commented that while White used techniques that would be acceptable for checking the electric propulsion of Hall thrusters, the tests were not sufficient to demonstrate that any new physics effect exists.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n, Cannae\\n, EmDrive\\n\\nBroadcast 2722 EM Drive @ The Space Show\\nVideos of presentations on EM Drive, Mach Effect, Cannae by March, Woodward, Tajmar and others at the 2016 Breakthrough Propulsion Workshop @ Space Studies Institute YouTube Playlist\\nTMRO video podcast #EMPossibleDrive 9.16 with builder Dave Distler @25 minutes in\\nEmDrive fails tests\\n\\nDiscovery and invention controversies\\nHypothetical technology\\nFringe physics\\nPropulsion\\nPseudoscience',\n",
       "       'Plectin is a giant protein found in nearly all mammalian cells which acts as a link between the three main components of the cytoskeleton: actin microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.  In addition, plectin links the cytoskeleton to junctions found in the plasma membrane that structurally connect different cells. By holding these different networks together, plectin plays an important role in maintaining the mechanical integrity and viscoelastic properties of tissues.\\n\\nStructure \\n\\nPlectin can exist in cells as several alternatively-spliced isoforms, all around 500 kDa and >4000 amino acids. The structure of plectin is thought to be a dimer consisting of a central coiled coil of alpha helices connecting two large globular domains (one at each terminus). These globular domains are responsible for connecting plectin to its various cytoskeletal targets. The carboxy-terminal domain is made of 6 highly homologous repeating regions. The subdomain between regions five and six of this domain is known to connect to the intermediate filaments cytokeratin and vimentin.  At the opposite end of the protein, in the N-terminal domain, a region has been defined as responsible for binding to actin. In 2004, the exact crystal structure of this actin-binding domain (ABD) was determined in mice and shown to be composed of two calponin homology (CH) domains. Plectin is expressed in nearly all mammalian tissues. In cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle, plectin is localized to specialized entities known as Z-discs. Plectin binds several proteins, including vinculin, DES, actin., fodrin, microtubule-associating proteins, nuclear laminin B., SPTAN1, vimentin and ITGB4.\\n\\nFunction \\n\\nStudies employing a plectin knockout mouse have shed light on the functions of plectin. Pups died 2–3 days after birth, and these mice exhibited marked skin abnormalities, including degeneration of keratinocytes. Skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues were also significantly affected. Cardiac intercalated discs were disintegrated and sarcomeres were irregularly shapen, and intracellular accumulation of aberrant isolated myofibrillar bundles and Z-disc components was also observed. Expression of vinculin in muscle cells was strikingly down-regulated. \\nThrough the use of gold-immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments plectin has been found to associate with all three major components of the cytoskeleton. In muscle, plectin binds to the periphery of Z-discs, and along with the intermediate filament protein desmin, may form lateral linkages among neighboring Z-discs. This interaction between plectin and desmin intermediate filaments also appears to facilitate the close association of myofibrils and mitochondria, both at Z-discs and along the remainder the sarcomere. Plectin also functions to link cytoskeleton to intercellular junctions, such as desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which link intermediate filament networks between cells. Plectin has been revealed to localize to the desmosomes and in vitro studies have shown that it can form bridges between the desmosome protein, desmoplakin and intermediate filaments. In hemidesmosomes plectin has been shown to interact with the integrin β4 subunits of the hemidesmosome plaque and function in a clamp-like manner to link the intermediate filament cytokeratin to the junction.\\n\\nClinical significance \\n\\nMutations in PLEC have been associated with epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy. A missense variant of PLEC has been recently proposed as a cause of atrial fibrillation in some populations. Isolated left ventricular non-compaction accompanying epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy was also noted.\\nPlectin has been proposed as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Although normally a cytoplasmic protein, plectin is expressed on the cell membrane in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and can therefore be used to target PDAC cells.\\n\\nSee also \\n List of target antigens in pemphigus\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nExternal links \\nMass spectrometry characterization of one isoform of PLEC at COPaKB.\\n  GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Epidermolysis Bullosa with Pyloric Atresia\\n \\n \\n\\nPlakins',\n",

       "       'In geometry, the Euler line, named after Leonhard Euler (), is a line determined from any triangle that is not equilateral. It is a central line of the triangle, and it\\npasses through several important points determined from the triangle, including the orthocenter, the circumcenter, the centroid, the Exeter point and the center of the nine-point circle of the triangle.\\n\\nThe concept of a triangle\\'s Euler line extends to the Euler line of other shapes, such as the quadrilateral and the tetrahedron.\\n\\nTriangle centers on the Euler line\\n\\nIndividual centers\\nEuler showed in 1765 that in any triangle, the orthocenter, circumcenter and centroid are collinear. This property is also true for another triangle center, the nine-point center, although it had not been defined in Euler\\'s time. In equilateral triangles, these four points coincide, but in any other triangle they are all distinct from each other, and the Euler line is determined by any two of them.\\n\\nOther notable points that lie on the Euler line include the de Longchamps point, the Schiffler point, the Exeter point, and the Gossard perspector. However, the incenter generally does not lie on the Euler line; it is on the Euler line only for isosceles triangles, for which the Euler line coincides with the symmetry axis of the triangle and contains all triangle centers.\\n\\nThe tangential triangle of a reference triangle is tangent to the latter\\'s circumcircle at the reference triangle\\'s vertices. The circumcenter of the tangential triangle lies on the Euler line of the reference triangle.  The center of similitude of the orthic and tangential triangles is also on the Euler line.\\n\\nA vector proof\\nLet  be a triangle. A proof of the fact that the circumcenter , the centroid  and the orthocenter  are collinear relies on free vectors. We start by stating the prerequisites.

However, most of the proofs of the problem of Sylvester rely on the fundamental properties of free vectors, independently of the Euler line.\\n\\nDistances between centers\\n\\nOn the Euler line the centroid G is between the circumcenter O and the orthocenter H and is twice as far from the orthocenter as it is from the circumcenter:\\n\\nThe segment GH is a diameter of the orthocentroidal circle.\\n\\nThe center N of the nine-point circle lies along the Euler line midway between the orthocenter and the circumcenter:\\n\\nThus the Euler line could be repositioned on a number line with the circumcenter O at the location 0, the centroid G at 2t, the nine-point center at 3t, and the orthocenter H at 6t for some scale factor t.\\n\\nFurthermore, the squared distance between the centroid and the circumcenter along the Euler line is less than the squared circumradius R2 by an amount equal to one-ninth the sum of the squares of the side lengths a, b, and c:\\n\\nIn addition,\\n\\nRepresentation\\n\\nEquation\\n\\nLet A, B, C denote the vertex angles of the reference triangle, and let x : y : z be a variable point in trilinear coordinates; then an equation for the Euler line is\\n\\nAn equation for the Euler line in barycentric coordinates  is\\n\\nParametric representation\\n\\nAnother way to represent the Euler line is in terms of a parameter t.

Seven lines associated with a tetrahedron are concurrent at its centroid; its six midplanes intersect at its Monge point; and there is a circumsphere passing through all of the vertices, whose center is the circumcenter. These points define the \"Euler line\" of a tetrahedron analogous to that of a triangle. The centroid is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter along this line. The center of the twelve-point sphere also lies on the Euler line.\\n\\nSimplicial polytope\\n\\nA simplicial polytope is a polytope whose facets are all simplices.

       "       '3-Deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase () is the first enzyme in a series of metabolic reactions known as the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Since it is the first enzyme in the shikimate pathway, it controls the amount of carbon entering the pathway. Enzyme inhibition is the primary method of regulating the amount of carbon entering the pathway. Forms of this enzyme differ between organisms, but can be considered DAHP synthase based upon the reaction that is catalyzed by this enzyme.\\n\\nIn enzymology, a DAHP synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction\\n\\nphosphoenolpyruvate + D-erythrose 4-phosphate + H2O  3-deoxy-D-arabino-hept-2-ulosonate 7-phosphate + phosphate\\n\\nThe three substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate, D-erythrose 4-phosphate, and H2O, whereas its two products are 3-deoxy-D-arabino-hept-2-ulosonate 7-phosphate and phosphate.\\n\\nNomenclature \\n\\nThis enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:D-erythrose-4-phosphate C-(1-carboxyvinyl)transferase (phosphate-hydrolysing, 2-carboxy-2-oxoethyl-forming). Other names in common use include 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphoheptonate aldolase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonic acid 7-phosphate synthetase, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthetase, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptolosonate-7-phosphate synthetase, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase, 7-phospho-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate D-erythrose-4-phosphate, lyase (pyruvate-phosphorylating), 7-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate, D-erythrose-4-phosphate lyase (pyruvate-phosphorylating), D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase, D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase (pyruvate-phosphorylating), DAH7-P synthase, DAHP synthase, DS-Co, DS-Mn, KDPH synthase, KDPH synthetase, deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase, phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyheptanoate aldolase, phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyheptonic aldolase, and phospho-2-oxo-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase.\\n\\nBiological function\\nThe primary function of DAHP synthase is to catalyze the reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate and D-erythrose 4-phosphate to DAHP and phosphate. However, another biological function of the enzyme is to regulate the amount of carbon that enters the shikimate pathway. This is accomplished primarily through two different methods, feedback inhibition and transcriptional control. Feedback inhibition and transcriptional control are both mechanisms of regulating carbon in bacteria, but the only mechanism of regulation found in DAHP synthase found in plants is transcriptional control.\\n\\nIn Escherichia coli, a species of bacteria, DAHP synthase is found as three isoenzymes, each of which sensitive to one of the amino acids produced in the shikimate pathway. In a study of DAHP synthase sensitive to tyrosine in E. coli, it was determined that the enzyme is inhibited by tyrosine through noncompetitive inhibition with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate, the first substrate of the reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthase, while the enzyme is inhibited by tyrosine through competitive inhibition with respect to D-erythrose 4-phosphate, the second substrate of the reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthase when the concentration of tyrosine is above 10 μM. It was also determined that the enzyme is inhibited by inorganic phosphate through noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both substrates and inhibited by DAHP through competitive inhibition with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate and noncompetitive inhibition with respect to D-erythrose 4-phosphate. Studies of product inhibition have shown that phosphoenolpyruvate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme complex, inorganic phosphate is the first product to dissociate from the enzyme complex. Thus the amount of carbon entering the shikimate pathway can be controlled by inhibiting DAHP synthase from catalyzing the reaction that forms DAHP.\\n\\nCarbon flow into the shikimate pathway in plants is regulated by transcriptional control. This method is also found in bacteria, but feedback inhibition is more prevalent.  In plants, as the plants progressed through the growth cycle, the activity of DAHP synthase changed.\\n\\nCatalytic activity\\nMetal ions are required in order for DAHP synthase to catalyze reactions. In DAHP synthase, it has been shown that binding site contains patterns of cysteine and histidine residues bound to metal ions in a Cys-X-X-His fashion.\\n\\nIt has been shown that, in general, DAHP synthases require a bivalent metal ion cofactor in order for the enzyme to function properly. Metal ions that can function as cofactors include Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+. Studies have suggested that one metal ion bonds to each monomer of DAHP synthase.\\n\\nThe reaction catalyzed by DAHP synthase is shown below.\\n\\nStructure \\n\\nThe quaternary structure of DAHP synthase consists of two tightly bound dimers, which means that DAHP synthase is a tetramer.\\n\\nTo the right is an image of DAHP synthase that shows the quaternary structure of DAHP synthase.

       "       'Organocerium compounds are chemical compounds that contain one or more chemical bond between carbon and cerium. Organocerium chemistry is the corresponding science exploring properties, structure and reactivity of these compounds. In general, organocerium compounds are not isolable, and are rather studied in solution via their reactions with other species. There are notable exceptions, such as the Cp*3Ce(III) complex shown at right, but they are relatively rare.  Complexes involving cerium of various oxidation states are known: though lanthanides are most stable in the +3 state, complexes of cerium(IV) have been reported. These latter compounds have found less widespread use due to their oxidizing nature, and the majority of literature regarding organometallic cerium complexes involves the +3 oxidation state. In particular, organocerium compounds have been developed extensively as non-basic carbon nucleophiles in organic synthesis. Because cerium is relatively non-toxic, they serve as an \"environmentally friendly\" alternative to other organometallic reagents. Several reviews detailing these applications have been published.\\n\\nStructure\\nThe solution structure of organocerium reagents remains unclear, although there is agreement that it depends heavily on the manner in which it is prepared. In particular, those derived from organolithium reagents likely are believed to form something similar to a \\'true\\' organocerium structure, \"R-CeCl2,\" while those derived from Grignard reagents are more appropriately characterized as -ate complexes of the form \"R-MgX•CeCl3\". Furthermore, the solvent seems to alter the solution structure of the complex, with differences noted between reagents prepared in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. There is evidence that the parent chloride forms a polymeric species in THF solution, of the form [Ce(μ-Cl)2(H2O)(THF)2]n, but whether this type of polymer exists once the organometallic reagent is formed is unknown.\\n\\nPreparation\\nOrganocerium compounds are typically prepared via transmetallation from the respective organolithium or Grignard reagent. The most common cerium source for this purpose is cerium (III) chloride, which can be obtained in anhydrous form via dehydration of the commercially available heptahydrate. Precomplexation with tetrahydrofuran is important for the success of the transmetallation, with most procedures involving \"vigorous stirring for a period of no less than 2 hours\".\\n\\nReagents derived from alkyl, alkynyl, and alkenyl organometallic reagents as well as cerium enolates have been described. The stability of each is approximately the same regardless of origin (i.e. lithiate or Grignard), with the exception of alkenyl reagents, which tend to be more stable when derived from the corresponding lithiate. The reasons for this are still poorly understood. Functional groups compatible with the parent organometallic compound are generally also stable upon transmetallation to cerium. The figure below summarizes the kinds of organocerium compounds that have been prepared.\\n\\nReactions\\nOrganocerium reagents are used almost exclusively for addition reactions in the same vein as organolithium and Grignard reagents. To this end, they have a number of particularly useful characteristics that distinguish them from their more common counterparts.\\n\\nThey are incredibly nucleophilic, allowing additions to imines in the absence of additional Lewis acid catalysts, making them useful for substrates in which typical conditions fail.\\n\\nDespite this high reactivity, organocerium reagents are almost entirely non-basic, tolerating the presence of free alcohols and amines as well as enolizable α-protons.\\n\\nThe oxophilicity of cerium imparts strong 1,2-selectivity in reactions with conjugated electrophiles similarly to organolithium reagents. At the same time, organocerium reagents can be used to synthesize ketones from acyl compounds without over-addition, as seen with organocuprates. This dichotomy illustrates the unique reactivity of organolanthanide reagents.\\n\\nFinally, organocerium reagents have been employed in a number of total syntheses. Shown below is a key coupling step in the total synthesis of roseophilin, a potent antitumor antibiotic.\\n\\nSee also\\n Luche reduction\\n Cerium\\n\\nReferences\\n\\ncerium\\ncerium\\nCerium',\n",
       "       'Chytridiomycota are a division of zoosporic organisms in the kingdom Fungi, informally known as chytrids. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek  (), meaning \"little pot\", describing the structure containing unreleased zoospores. Chytrids are one of the early diverging fungal lineages, and their membership in kingdom Fungi is demonstrated with chitin cell walls, a posterior whiplash flagellum, absorptive nutrition, use of glycogen as an energy storage compound, and synthesis of lysine by the α-amino adipic acid (AAA) pathway.\\n\\nChytrids are saprobic, degrading refractory materials such as chitin and keratin, and sometimes act as parasites. There has been a significant increase in the research of chytrids since the discovery of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causal agent of chytridiomycosis.\\n\\nClassification\\nSpecies of Chytridiomycota have traditionally been delineated and classified based on development, morphology, substrate, and method of zoospore discharge. However, single spore isolates (or isogenic lines) display a great amount of variation in many of these features; thus, these features cannot be used to reliably classify or identify a species. Currently, taxonomy in Chytridiomycota is based on molecular data, zoospore ultrastructure and some aspects of thallus morphology and development.\\n\\nIn an older and more restricted sense (not used here), the term \"chytrids\" referred just to those fungi in the class Chytridiomycetes. Here, the term \"chytrid\" refers to all members of Chytridiomycota.\\n \\nThe chytrids have also been included among the Protoctista, but are now regularly classed as fungi.\\n\\nIn older classifications, chytrids, except the recently established order Spizellomycetales, were placed in the class Phycomycetes under the subphylum Myxomycophyta of the kingdom Fungi. Previously, they were placed in the Mastigomycotina as the class Chytridiomycetes. The other classes of the Mastigomycotina, the Hyphochytriomycetes and Oomycetes, were removed from the fungi to be classified as heterokont pseudofungi.\\n\\nThe class Chytridiomycetes has over 750 chytrid species distributed among ten orders. Additional classes include the Monoblepharidomycetes, with two orders, and the Hyaloraphidiomycetes with a single order.\\n\\nMolecular phylogenetics, and other techniques such as ultrastructure analysis, has greatly increased the understanding of chytrid phylogeny, and led to the formation of several new zoosporic fungal phyla:\\n\\n The order Blastocladiales, originally within the Chytridiomycota, are now classified as a separate phylum, the Blastocladiomycota.\\n The Neocallimastigales, originally an order of anaerobic fungi of the class Chytridiomycetes, found in the digestive tracts of herbivores, was later raised to a separate phylum, the Neocallimastigomycota.\\n The Olpidiaceae, including the type genus Olpidium, formerly classified in the order Chytridiales, were raised to a separate phylum, the Olpidiomycota.\\n\\nLife cycle and body plan\\nChytridiomycota are unusual among the Fungi in that they reproduce with zoospores. For most members of Chytridiomycetes, sexual reproduction is not known. Asexual reproduction occurs through the release of zoospores (presumably) derived through mitosis.\\n\\nWhere it has been described, sexual reproduction of Chytridomycetes occurs via a variety of methods. It is generally accepted that the resulting zygote forms a resting spore, which functions as a means of surviving adverse conditions. In some members, sexual reproduction is achieved through the fusion of isogametes (gametes of the same size and shape). This group includes the notable plant pathogens Synchytrium. Some algal parasites practice oogamy: a motile male gamete attaches itself to a nonmotile structure containing the female gamete. In another group, two thalli produce tubes that fuse and allow the gametes to meet and fuse. In the last group, rhizoids of compatible strains meet and fuse. Both nuclei migrate out of the zoosporangium and into the conjoined rhizoids where they fuse. The resulting zygote germinates into a resting spore.\\n\\nSexual reproduction is common and well known among members of the Monoblepharidomycetes. Typically, these chytrids practice a version of oogamy: the male is motile and the female is stationary. This is the first occurrence of oogamy in kingdom Fungi. Briefly, the monoblephs form oogonia, which give rise to eggs, and antheridia, which give rise to male gametes. Once fertilized, the zygote either becomes an encysted or motile oospore, which ultimately becomes a resting spore that will later germinate and give rise to new zoosporangia.\\n\\nUpon release from the germinated resting spore, zoospores seek out a suitable substrate for growth using chemotaxis or phototaxis. Some species encyst and germinate directly upon the substrate; others encyst and germinate a short distance away. Once germinated, enzymes released from the zoospore begin to break down the substrate and utilize it produce a new thallus. Thalli are coenocytic and usually form no true mycelium (having rhizoids instead).\\n\\nChytrids have several different growth patterns. Some are holocarpic, which means they only produce a zoosporangium and zoospores. Others are eucarpic, meaning they produce other structures, such as rhizoids, in addition to the zoosporangium and zoospores. Some chytrids are monocentric, meaning a single zoospore gives rise to a single zoosporangium. Others are polycentric, meaning one zoospore gives rise to many zoosporangium connected by a rhizomycelium. Rhizoids do not have nuclei while a rhizomycelium can.\\n\\nGrowth continues until a new batch of zoospores are ready for release. Chytrids have a diverse set of release mechanisms that can be grouped into the broad categories of operculate or inoperculate. Operculate discharge involves the complete or incomplete detachment of a lid-like structure, called an operculum, allowing the zoospores out of the sporangium. Inoperculate chytrids release their zoospores through pores, slits, or papillae.\\n\\nHabitats \\nChytrids are aquatic fungi, though those that thrive in the capillary network around soil particles are typically considered terrestrial. The zoospore is primarily a means of thoroughly exploring a small volume of water for a suitable substrate rather than a means of long-range dispersal.\\n\\nChytrids have been isolated from a variety of aquatic habitats, including peats, bogs, rivers, ponds, springs, and ditches, and terrestrial habitats, such as acidic soils, alkaline soils, temperate forest soils, rainforest soils, Arctic and Antarctic soils. This has led to the belief that many chytrid species are ubiquitous and cosmopolitan. However, recent taxonomic work has demonstrated that this ubiquitous and cosmopolitan morphospecies hide cryptic diversity at the genetic and ultrastructural levels. It was first thought aquatic chytrids (and other zoosporic fungi) were primarily active in fall, winter, and spring. However, recent molecular inventories of lakes during the summer indicate that chytrids are an active, diverse part of the eukaryotic microbial community.\\n\\nOne of the least expected terrestrial environments the chytrid thrive in are periglacial soils. The population of the Chytridiomycota species are able to be supported even though there is a lack of plant life in these frozen regions due to the large amounts of water in periglacial soil and pollen blowing up from below the timberline.\\n\\nEcological functions\\n\\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis\\n\\nThe chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is responsible for chytridiomycosis, a disease of amphibians. Discovered in 1998 in Australia and Panama this disease is known to kill amphibians in large numbers, and has been suggested as a principal cause for the worldwide amphibian decline. Outbreaks of the fungus were found responsible for killing much of the Kihansi Spray Toad population in its native habitat of Tanzania, as well as the extinction of the golden toad in 1989. Chytridiomycosis has also been implicated in the presumed extinction of the Southern Gastric Brooding Frog, last seen in the wild in 1981, and the Northern Gastric Brooding Frog, last recorded in the wild in March 1985. The process leading to frog mortality is thought to be the loss of essential ions through pores made in the epidermal cells by the chytrid during its replication.\\n\\nRecent research has revealed that elevating salt levels slightly may be able to cure chytridiomycosis in some Australian frog species, although further experimentation is needed.\\n\\nOther parasites\\nChytrids mainly infect algae and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes. The infection can be so severe as to control primary production within the lake. It has been suggested that parasitic chytrids have a large effect on lake and pond food webs. Chytrids may also infect plant species; in particular, Synchytrium endobioticum is an important potato pathogen.\\n\\nSaprobes\\nArguably, the most important ecological function chytrids perform is decomposition. These ubiquitous and cosmopolitan organisms are responsible for decomposition of refractory materials, such as pollen, cellulose, chitin, and keratin. \\nThere are also chytrids that live and grow on pollen by attaching threadlike structures, called rhizoids, onto the pollen grains. This mostly occurs during asexual reproduction because the zoospores that become attached to the pollen continuously reproduce and form new chytrids that will attach to other pollen grains for nutrients. This colonization of pollen happens during the spring time when bodies of water accumulate pollen falling from trees and plants.\\n\\nFossil record\\nThe earliest fossils of chytrids are from the Scottish Rhynie chert, a Devonian-age lagerstätte with anatomical preservation of plants and fungi. Among the microfossils are chytrids preserved as parasites on rhyniophytes. These fossils closely resemble the modern genus Allomyces. Holocarpic chytrid remains were found in cherts from Combres in central France that date back to the late Visean. These remains were found along with eucarpic remains and are ambiguous in nature although they are thought to be of chytrids. Other chytrid-like fossils were found in cherts from the upper Pennsylvanian in the Saint-Etienne Basin in France, dating between 300 and 350ma.\\n\\nIn fictional media\\n\\nThe novel Tom Clancy\\'s Splinter Cell: Fallout (2007) features a species of chytrid that feeds on petroleum and oil-based products. In the story the species is modified using nuclear radiation, to increase the rate at which it feeds on oil. It is then used by Islamic extremists in an attempt to destroy the world\\'s oil supplies, thereby taking away the technological advantage of the United States.\\n\\nThe webcomic Black Mudpuppy by Ethan Kocak features an arc with an evil, anthropomorphic chytrid developed as a Nazi experiment to infect Xolotl, a giant, talking black axolotl.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n\\n Chytrid Fungi Online: by the University of Alabama\\nLongcore Lab from University of Maine--Including links on how to isolate and culture chytrids\\n Introduction to the Chytridiomycota: at the UC Museum of Paleontology\\n Impact of chytrid fungus on frogs (Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife)\\n \\'Amphibian Ark\\' aims to save frogs from fungus\\n The Aquarium Wiki Encyclopaedia on Chytrid Fungus and how it impacts amphibians kept as domestic pets.\\n \\n\\n \\nAquatic fungi\\nFungus phyla\\nFungi by classification',\n",

       "       \"Kappa Fornacis (κ For) is a star system that lies approximately 72 light-years away. The system consists of a somewhat evolved primary orbited by a massive, 'dark' secondary that is actually itself a close red dwarf binary, making a hierarchal triple system.\\n\\nMultiplicity \\nKappa Fornacis was found to be 0.23 arcseconds north of an X-ray and Radio source in 1995, a distance so close that it is most likely associated with the star. While this would indicate that the star is active and therefore young, private communication indicated that Kappa Fornacis was a spectroscopic binary, leaving the possibility that a companion star was the source of the excess emission.\\n\\nThe Hipparcos mission detected a large 19.4 mas/year acceleration in the proper motion of Kappa Fornacis, suggesting that part of an orbit was being observed. Combining this with other proper motion data spanning approximately half a century indicated a periodic variation of 26.5 ± 2 years, confirming that the star is an astrometric binary. The amplitude of the variation indicated a mass sum of ; with a primary of approximately , it was evident that the two components must have approximately equal masses. However, as the companion's light or spectrum was not observed, it was clear that it was fainter than a main sequence star. This was interpreted as the companion being a white dwarf.\\n\\nApparently unaware of the indication of binarity, Kappa Fornacis was included in several radial velocity-based planet searches that began towards the end of the century. A long-period variability was obvious; a linear trend of -1.73 ± 0.02\\xa0m/s/d was found by the CCPS, while the longer time series of the ESO-CES survey, non-linearity in the trend was apparent and a preliminary orbit was presented, considerably shorter than the astrometric one. Abt et al. 2006 expanded upon this with new and historical data to find a more precise orbit, again shorter than the astrometric one. More recently, a continuation of the ESO-CES survey to the HARPS spectrograph indicates that the companion's orbital period is somewhat longer, more consistent with the astrometric period.\\n\\nKappa Fornacis B was first resolved independently by Lafrenière et al. (2007) and Tokovinin and Cantarutti (2008), both finding a separation of about 0.5 arcseconds that is consistent with the astrometric orbit. The difference in brightness between the two components confirmed that the secondary is overly faint for its mass; The latter paper ascribes this to it being a massive white dwarf or a close M-dwarf binary, but could not discriminate between the two possibilities. The companion has been resolved several times since, allowing for a preliminary visual orbit to be made by 2012.\\n\\nTokovinin (2013) combined spectroscopic and visual data on the system to find the most accurate determination of the binary orbit thus far. While the photometric colours of the secondary are consistent with an early M-dwarf (), it lies above the main sequence, meaning that its luminosity is too high to be a single star. This means that the secondary must actually be two close stars of similar spectral type, themselves orbiting the more massive primary. Two faint absorption lines were weakly detected in the Hα line, varying by about 80\\xa0km/s over a period of a few days; these are consistent with two M-dwarfs orbiting each other, confirming that the secondary is a close binary. The subsystem consists of two approximately equal-mass red dwarfs orbiting each other every ~3.7 days. Binaries with such close orbits typically maintain high levels of activity for their lifetimes due to their rotational periods being synchronised to their orbital period, so the components of the secondary are the source of the excess energy in the system.\\n\\nProperties \\n     \\n     \\n     \\nIn terms of an object on the celestial sphere, Kappa Fornacis is a fifth magnitude star that lies close to the border between the northerly border of Fornax with Cetus. At magnitude 5.2, it is approximately the seventh-brightest star in the constellation.\\n\\nKappa Fornacis A's colours and temperature indicate that it has a spectral type of G1\\xa0V, meaning that it is about 100 kelvins hotter than the Sun. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (left) the star lies somewhat above the main sequence, indicating that it is in the process of evolving between the dwarf and subgiant stage; this is supported by its surface gravity being lower than a typical G-dwarf and its low level of chromospheric activity (log R'HK ≈ -5.0). The star has a mass that is about a fifth larger than solar, a value that would be typical of a late F-dwarf (~F7V) when it was on the main sequence. Different methods to estimate the age of the star generally agree that Kappa Fornacis A is 5 to 6 billion years old, making it perhaps 1 billion years older than the Sun. This age corresponds to both the oldest members of the thin disk and the youngest members of the thick disk, though the system falls into the former population based on its kinematics (UVW = -19.5, -16.2, -9.6\\xa0km/s) and its close-to-solar metallicity.\\n\\nThe two components of Kappa Fornacis B are both early M-dwarfs. Assuming that they are identical, they both have masses approximately half that of the Sun. Because they are in such a short-period orbit, tidal effects will maintain a high level of activity on both stars (in analogue with CM Draconis), meaning that they likely experience flares and rotational variation (BY Draconis variability).\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nG-type subgiants\\nM-type main-sequence stars\\nTriple star systems\\nAstrometric binaries\\nSpectroscopic binaries\\n\\nFornax (constellation)\\nFornacis, Kappa\\nDurchmusterung objects\\n0097\\n014802\\n011072\\n0695\"],\n",
