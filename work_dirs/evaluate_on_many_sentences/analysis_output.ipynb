In astronomy and cosmology, baryonic dark matter is hypothetical dark matter composed of baryons. The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. == Temperature and density == Clusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. Note: See section 7.8: Halo Model of Galaxy Clustering The halo model provides one view of the large scale structure of the universe as clumps of dark matter, while the HOD provides a view of how galactic matter is distributed within each of the dark matter clumps. A 2021 article postulated that approximately 50% of all baryonic matter is outside dark matter haloes, filling the space between galaxies, and that this would explain the missing baryons not accounted for in the 2017 paper. == Current state == Currently, many groups have observed the intergalactic medium and circum-galactic medium to obtain more measurements and observations of baryons to support the leading observations. In cosmology, the missing baryon problem is an observed discrepancy between the amount of baryonic matter detected from shortly after the Big Bang and from more recent epochs. Brownstein and Moffat use a theory of modified gravity to explain X-ray cluster masses without dark matter. This form of dark matter is composed of \"baryons\", heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms. ==Presence== Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) – condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs. ==Estimates of quantity== The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then there would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. The missing baryon problem has been resolved but research groups are working to detect the WHIM using varying methods to confirm results. ==References== Category:Physical cosmology Category:Baryons The HOD is used to describe three related properties of the halo model: the probability distribution relating the mass of a dark matter halo to the number of galaxies that form within that halo; the distribution in space of galactic matter within a dark matter halo; the distribution of velocities of galactic matter relative to dark matter within a dark matter halo. ==See also== * Dark matter * Large- scale structure of the cosmos * Galaxy formation and evolution ==References== Category:Galaxies Category:Large-scale structure of the cosmos Baryons make up only ~5% of the universe, while dark matter makes up 26.8%. ==Early universe measurements== The abundance of baryonic matter in the early universe can be obtained indirectly from two independent methods: * The theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which predicts the observed relative abundance of the chemical elements in observations of the recent universe. Both indicate that the amount of baryonic dark matter is much smaller than the total amount of dark matter. ===Big Bang nucleosynthesis=== From the perspective of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining. The missing baryon problem is different from the dark matter problem, which is non-baryonic in nature.See Lambda-CDM model. However, although there seem to be enough observed normal-sized galaxies to match the simulated distribution of dark matter halos of comparable mass, the number of observed dwarf galaxies is orders of magnitude lower than expected from such simulation. ==Context== For example, around 38 dwarf galaxies have been observed in the Local Group, and only around 11 orbiting the Milky Way,For a detailed and up to date list see List of Milky Way's satellite galaxies. yet dark matter simulations predict that there should be around 500 dwarf satellites for the Milky Way alone. ==Prospective resolution== There are two main alternatives which may resolve the dwarf galaxy problem: The smaller-sized clumps of dark matter may be unable to obtain or retain the baryonic matter needed to form stars in the first place; or, after they form, dwarf galaxies may be quickly “eaten” by the larger galaxies that they orbit. ===Baryonic matter too sparse=== One proposal is that the smaller halos do exist but that only a few of them end up becoming visible, because they are unable to acquire enough baryonic matter to form a visible dwarf galaxy. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter. In astronomy, a RAMBO or robust association of massive baryonic objects is a dark cluster made of brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. Only a small proportion of the dark matter in the universe is likely to be baryonic. ==Characteristics== As \"dark matter\", baryonic dark matter is undetectable by its emitted radiation, but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. It is composed of mostly ionized hydrogen and is about 10% of a galaxy cluster's total mass; the rest being dark matter. This is highly nontrivial, since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed, baryonic matter can also exist in highly non-luminous form, such as black holes, planets, and highly diffuse interstellar gas. Interacting galaxies (colliding galaxies) are galaxies whose gravitational fields result in a disturbance of one another. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from theory predict that a fraction of the missing baryons are located in galactic haloes at temperatures of 106 K and the (WHIM) at temperatures of 105–107 K, with recent observations providing strong support. 50x50px Available under CC BY 4.0. In models for the gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies. Large scale galaxy surveys in the 2000s revealed a baryon deficit. At the same time, a census of baryons in the recent observable universe has found that observed baryonic matter accounts for less than half of that amount. A mass deficit is the amount of mass (in stars) that has been removed from the center of a galaxy, presumably by the action of a binary supermassive black hole. thumb|left|The figure illustrates how mass deficits are measured, using the observed brightness profile of a galaxy The density of stars increases toward the center in most galaxies. One claim of a solution was published in 2017 when two groups of scientists said they found evidence for the location of missing baryons in intergalactic matter. When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. * Gravitational lensing: Clusters of galaxies contain enough matter to distort the observed orientations of galaxies behind them. Prior to 2017, baryons were found to be distributed 10% inside galaxies, 50–60% in the circum-galactic medium, and 30–40% unaccounted, therefore accounting for about 70% of theoretical predictions. Galaxy groups and clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound objects to have arisen thus far in the process of cosmic structure formation. Observations of the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang nucleosynthesis studies have set constraints on the abundance of baryons in the early universe, finding that baryonic matter accounts for approximately 4.8% of the energy contents of the Universe. Around 7% of baryons exists in stars and galaxies, while most of it exists around galaxies or galaxy clusters. This is in distinction from composition of the entire universe which includes dark energy and dark matter of which baryonic matter composes only 5%. In simulations, dark matter clusters hierarchically, in ever increasing numbers of halo \"blobs\" as halos' components' sizes become smaller-and-smaller. Streams of gravitationally-attracted hydrogen arcing from these dwarf galaxies to the Milky Way is taken as evidence for the theory. == Galaxy harassment == Galaxy harassment is a type of interaction between a low-luminosity galaxy and a brighter one that takes place within rich galaxy clusters, such as Virgo and Coma, where galaxies are moving at high relative speeds and suffering frequent encounters with other systems of the cluster by the high galactic density of the latter. However, this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. In July 2017 S. Paul, R. S. John et al. defined clear distinguishing parameters for classifying galaxy aggregations as ‘galaxy groups’ and ‘clusters’ on the basis of scaling laws that they followed. Tidal stripping may also have been part of the problem of detecting dwarf galaxies in the first place: Finding dwarf galaxies is an extremely difficult task, since they tend to have low surface brightness and are highly diffuse – so much so that they are close to blending into background and foreground stars. ==See also== *Dark galaxy *Cold dark matter *Cuspy halo problem (also known as \"the core/cusp problem\") *List of unsolved problems in physics ==Footnotes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Dark matter Category:Galaxies Category:Large- scale structure of the cosmos Category:Unsolved problems in physics The dwarf galaxy problem, also known as the missing satellites problem, arises from a mismatch between observed dwarf galaxy numbers and collisionless numerical cosmological simulations that predict the evolution of the distribution of matter in the universe. The CMB constraint is much more precise than the BBN constraint, but the two are in agreement. ==Late universe observations== The density of baryonic matter can be obtained directly by summing up all the known baryonic matter. The missing component is known as dark matter and its nature is unknown. Where \\Omega_O is the abundance of a particular oxygen ion, H_0 is Hubble's constant, \\rho_c is the critical density \\rho_c = \\frac{3H^2}{8\\pi G}. ==Claimed resolutions== In general, the missing baryon problem is a major unsolved problem in physics. According to this paper, galaxy aggregations less massive than 8 × 1013 solar masses are classified as galaxy groups. == Clusters of galaxies == Clusters are larger than groups, although there is no sharp dividing line between the two. File:Hubble Frontier Fields view of MACSJ0416.1–2403.jpg|Galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1–2403 is one of six being studied by the Hubble Frontier Fields programme. ==References== Category:Dark matter Category:Galaxy clusters Category:Eridanus (constellation) The CGM accounts for 5% of total baryons in the universe. == Detection methods == There are three main methods of detecting the WHIM where the missing baryons lie: the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, Lyman-alpha emission lines, and metal absorption lines. This creates difficulty for astronomers trying to detect baryons in the WHIM. The halo occupation distribution (HOD) is a parameter of the halo model of galaxy clustering. Other possibilities that were examined include \"Jupiters\", which are similar to brown dwarfs but have masses \\sim and do not burn anything, and white dwarfs. ==See also== *Particle chauvinism == References == Category:Dark matter Category:Baryons Even if granted to be accurate, these works only describe the distribution of baryons between nearby galaxies and do not provide a complete picture of cosmic gas in the late universe. The result would be the conversion of (late type) low-luminosity spiral galaxies into dwarf spheroidals and dwarf ellipticals.Galaxy Harassment Evidence for the hypothesis had been claimed by studying early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo Cluster and finding structures, such as disks and spiral arms, which suggest they are former disk systems transformed by the above-mentioned interactions.More evidence for hidden spiral and bar features in bright early- type dwarf galaxies However, the existence of similar structures in isolated early-type dwarf galaxies, such as LEDA 2108986, has undermined this hypothesisGraham, A.W. et al.

These properties are consistent with what is predicted in theoretical models of core formation and lend support to the hypothesis that all bright galaxies once contained binary SMBHs at their centers. MACS J0416.1-2403 is a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.397 with a mass 160 trillion times the mass of the Sun inside . According to computer simulations, the interactions convert the affected galaxy disks into disturbed barred spiral galaxies and produces starbursts followed by, if more encounters occur, loss of angular momentum and heating of their gas. It turns out the total mass deduced from this measurement is approximately six times larger than the mass of the galaxies or the hot gas. The census of known baryons in the universe tallied to around 60% of total baryons until the resolution of the missing baryon problem. If baryons are present there, then some amount of energy should be lost when light from the cosmic microwave background scatters off of them. It is not known whether most galaxies still contain massive binaries, or whether the two black holes have coalesced. The clusters themselves are often associated with larger, non-gravitationally bound, groups called superclusters. == Groups of galaxies == thumb|Map of the positions of thousands of galaxies in the VIPERS survey Groups of galaxies are the smallest aggregates of galaxies. Colliding galaxies are common during galaxy evolution.space.com 2015-04-21 How the Hubble Space Telescope Changed Our View of the Cosmos-Galactic Collisions Photographs The extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies means these are not collisions in the traditional sense of the word, but rather gravitational interactions. In support of this, in 2007 the Keck telescopes observed eight newly-discovered ultra-faint Milky Way dwarf satellites of which six were around 99.9% dark matter (with a mass-to-light ratio of about 1,000). ===Early demise of young dwarfs=== The other popular proposed solution is that dwarf galaxies may tend to merge into the galaxies they orbit shortly after star-formation, or to be quickly torn apart and tidally stripped by larger galaxies, due to complicated orbital interactions. Clusters have two important properties: their masses are large enough to retain any energetic gas ejected from member galaxies and the thermal energy of the gas within the cluster is observable within the X-Ray bandpass. This discrepancy is commonly known as the missing baryon problem. The images, released in 2014, were used in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) to help scientists peer back in time at the early Universe and to discover the distribution of dark matter. ==Gallery== File:A cosmic kaleidoscope.jpg|MACS J0416.1-2403 contains a significant amount of dark matter, which leaves a detectable imprint in visible light by distorting the images of background galaxies. This led theorists to reexamine their models and predict that gas must flow between galaxies and galaxy clusters. ===Warm-Hot intergalactic medium=== The Lambda-CDM model of the big bang predicts that matter between galaxies in the universe is distributed in web-like formations with a low density (1 - 10 particles per cubic meter) known as the Warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Galaxy clusters are found by optical or infrared telescopes by searching for overdensities, and then confirmed by finding several galaxies at a similar redshift. Baryons have more or less been found, so groups are working to detect them to a higher level of significance. They may have an effective radius between 1 and 15 pc, with masses in the range .Moore, B., & Silk, J. 1995, Astrophysical Journal, 442, L5-L8 (ADS entry ) == Dynamics == The dynamics of these objects, if they do exist, must be quite different from that of standard star clusters. An example of a minor interaction is a satellite galaxy disturbing the primary galaxy's spiral arms. File:Colliding Galaxies Create Active Galactic Nuclei.OGG|This simulation follows the collision of two spiral galaxies that harbour giant black holes. It is easier to detect the WHIM through highly ionized oxygen such as OVI and OVII absorption. == Universe composition == thumb|458x458px|The distribution of known baryons in the universe. The CGM is a large sphere surrounding galaxies with a radius > 70 - 200 kpc. Galactic collisions are now frequently simulated on computers, which use realistic physics principles, including the simulation of gravitational forces, gas dissipation phenomena, star formation, and feedback. Groups and clusters may contain ten to thousands of individual galaxies. Based on the distribution of the multiple image copies, scientists have been able to deduce and map the distribution of dark matter. The most common result of the gravitational merger between two or more galaxies is an irregular galaxy, but elliptical galaxies may also result. A library of simulated galaxy collisions can be found at the Paris Observatory website: GALMER GALMER 27 March 2010 ==Gallery== File:Galactic Creatures at Play.jpg|UGC 2369 taken by HST. The missing baryons had been postulated to exist as hot strands between galaxy pairs (WHIM). However, their velocities are too large for them to remain gravitationally bound by their mutual attractions, implying the presence of either an additional invisible mass component, or an additional attractive force besides gravity. File:Faint Compact Galaxy in the Early Universe.jpg|Very massive cluster of galaxies, MACS0416.1-2403, located roughly 4 billion light-years away. Higher numbers of baryons in the early universe should produce higher ratios for helium, lithium, and heavier elements relative to hydrogen.Achim Weiss, \"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements \" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017 Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's critical density. Groups have a mass range between those of the very large elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Colliding may lead to merging if two galaxies collide and do not have enough momentum to continue traveling after the collision. They form the densest part of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Baryonic matter interacts with photons and therefore leaves a visible imprint on the CMB. The mass of the dark object can be inferred based on the amount of distortion. Both possibilities are consistent with the presence of mass deficits. ==References== ==External links== *Ferrarese, L. and Merritt, D. (2002). Observed mass deficits are typically in the range of one to a few times the mass of the central SMBH, and observed core radii are comparable to the influence radii of the central SMBH. The complex motions of gravitational perturbations can be broken down. CMB analysis also yields a baryon fraction on the order of 5%. In large galaxies, there is usually a \"core\", a region near the center where the density is constant or slowly rising. It is thought that the two spiral galaxies will eventually merge to become an elliptical galaxywhose gravitational interactions will fling various celestial bodies outward, evicting them from the resulting elliptical galaxy.Astronomy, June 2008, page 28, by Abraham Loeb and T.J.Cox or perhaps a large disk galaxy. ==See also== * NGC 7318 ==References== ==External links== *Galaxy Collisions *Galactic cannibalism *Galactic Collision Simulation *GALMER: Galaxy Merger Simulations Category:Extragalactic astronomy Category:Articles containing video clips This cluster causes gravitational lensing of distant galaxies producing multiple images. Dynamical friction slows the relative motion galaxy pairs, which may possibly merge at some point, according to the initial relative energy of the orbits. The total mass of the gas is greater than that of the galaxies by roughly a factor of two. Galactic cannibalism is a common phenomenon that occurs in the universe, which refers to the process in which a large galaxy, through tidal gravitational interactions with a companion, merges with that companion; that results in a larger, often irregular galaxy. Its mass extends out to a radius of and was measured as 1.15 × 1015 solar masses. * Gravitational microlensing. File:Defying cosmic convention.jpg|NGC 3447 comprises a couple of interacting galaxies. File:The messy result of a galactic collision.jpg|ESO 576-69 is believed to be the nucleus of a former spiral galaxy. The mass deficit is defined as the amount of mass that was removed in creating the core. If one of the colliding galaxies is much larger than the other, it will remain largely intact after the merger. Mathematically, the mass deficit is defined asM_\\mathrm{def} = 4 \\pi \\int_0^{R_c} \\left[\\rho_i(r) - \\rho(r) \\right]r^2 dr, where ρi is the original density, ρ is the observed density, and Rc is the core radius. The larger galaxy will look much the same, while the smaller galaxy will be stripped apart and become part of the larger galaxy. To better understand this thermal history one needs to study the entropy of the gas because entropy is the quantity most directly changed by increasing or decreasing the thermal energy of intracluster gas. == List of groups and clusters == Name / Designation Notes Local Group The group where the Milky Way, including the Earth is located Virgo Cluster This cluster of galaxies is the nearest one to us == See also == * Entropy * Fossil galaxy group * Galactic orientation * Galaxy filament * Illustris project * Intracluster medium * Large-scale structure of the Cosmos * List of galaxy groups and clusters * Supercluster * Timeline of knowledge about galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale structure == References == == Further reading == * Category:Large-scale structure of the cosmos tr:Galaksi kümesi An example of a major interaction is a galactic collision, which may lead to a galaxy merger. ==Satellite interaction== A giant galaxy interacting with its satellites is common. When galaxies pass through each other, unlike during mergers, they largely retain their material and shape after the pass. Binary SMBHs form during the merger of two galaxies. In small galaxies, this increase continues into the very center. The gravitational effects of the other bodies can be treated as perturbations of the hypothetical unperturbed motion of the planet or satellite around its primary body. == Mathematical analysis == === General perturbations === In methods of general perturbations, general differential equations, either of motion or of change in the orbital elements, are solved analytically, usually by series expansions. Closing the loop: Testing Newtonian Gravity, Then and Now); and Prof R F Egerton (Portland State University, Oregon) after quoting the same passage from Newton concluded: \"Here, Newton identifies the \"many body problem\" which remains unsolved analytically.\" Such orphaned clusters of stars were sometimes referred to as \"blue blobs\" before they were recognized as stars. thumb|Animation of Galaxy Collision ==Galaxy collision== thumb|Merging galaxies in the distant Universe through a gravitational magnifying glass. Their mass is approximately 1013 solar masses. However, this definition should be used as a guide only, as larger and more massive galaxy systems are sometimes classified as galaxy groups. Clusters are quite prominent in X-ray surveys and along with AGN are the brightest X-ray emitting extragalactic objects. In the Solar System, this is usually the case; Jupiter, the second largest body, has a mass of about 1/1000 that of the Sun. General perturbation methods are preferred for some types of problems, as the source of certain observed motions are readily found. With a very narrow mass range (all brown dwarfs or white dwarfs), the evaporation rate of these RAMBOs should be very slow as predicted by the evolution of simulated mono-component cluster models.de la Fuente Marcos, R. 1995, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 301, 407-418 (ADS entry ) Theoretically, these very long-lived objects could exist in large numbers. The intracluster medium (ICM) accounts for around 4% of total baryon content. They typically contain no more than 50 galaxies in a diameter of 1 to 2 megaparsecs (Mpc)(see 1022 m for distance comparisons). For detecting baryons, the ionized gas from the WHIM is scattered by the CMB photons. The system was discovered in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope during the Massive Cluster Survey, MACS. Groups are the most common structures of galaxies in the universe, comprising at least 50% of the galaxies in the local universe. Such cores are ubiquitous in giant elliptical galaxies. In astronomy, perturbation is the complex motion of a massive body subjected to forces other than the gravitational attraction of a single other massive body.Bate, Mueller, White (1971): ch. 9, p. 385. The groups used the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect to measure the density of the strands in the local universe. In that case, they fall back into each other and eventually merge into one galaxy after many passes through each other. For example, in April 1996, Jupiter's gravitational influence caused the period of Comet Hale–Bopp's orbit to decrease from 4,206 to 2,380 years, a change that will not revert on any periodic basis. == See also == * Formation and evolution of the Solar System * Frozen orbit * Molniya orbit * Nereid one of the outer moons of Neptune with a high orbital eccentricity of ~0.75 and is frequently perturbed * Osculating orbit * Orbit modeling * Orbital resonance * Proper orbital elements * Stability of the Solar System == References == ;Bibliography * * * ;Footnotes ==Further reading== * P.E.

The size of the core – the \"core radius\" – can be a few hundred parsecs in large elliptical galaxies.Dullo, Bililign T.; Graham, Alister W. (2014) Depleted cores, multicomponent fits, and structural parameter relations for luminous early-type galaxies The greatest observed stellar cores reach 3.2 to 5.7 kiloparsecs in radius. The circum-galactic medium (CGM) was confirmed in 2003 by Chandra and Xmm-Newton. As with other galaxy collisions, the merging of two galaxies may create a starburst region of new stars. Supermassive Black Holes. Most systems that involve multiple gravitational attractions present one primary body which is dominant in its effects (for example, a star, in the case of the star and its planet, or a planet, in the case of the planet and its satellite). This effect is sensitive to all free electrons independently of their temperature or the density of the surrounding medium, and thus it can be used to study baryonic matter otherwise not hot enough to be detected. That can possibly trigger a small amount of star formation. However, for many problems in celestial mechanics, this is never the case. This can be applied generally to many different sets of conditions, and is not specific to any particular set of gravitating objects.Bate, Mueller, White (1971): p. 387; sec. 9.4.3, p. 410. In 2020 astrophysicists reported the first direct X-ray emissions measurement of baryonic matter of cosmic web filaments, strengthening empirical support for the recent solution to the problem. The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 150 km/s. The differences between that and the actual motion of the body are perturbations due to the additional gravitational effects of the remaining body or bodies. The resulting spectra can be used to infer the mass between the star and the observer. Finding the y-parameter and overlaying that with a map of cosmic filament from millions of galaxies allows astronomers to find the weak signal from the WHIM. Category:Astrophysics Category:Supermassive black holes If a star passes near the massive binary, it will be ejected, by a process called the gravitational slingshot. The warm phase of the WHIM had been previously detected and composes around 15% of the baryon content. Various scientists have proposed explanations, but none have received acceptance as adequately addressing the issue. Since this gas is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium with the overall cluster gravitational field, the total mass distribution can be determined. The other forces can include a third (fourth, fifth, etc.) body, resistance, as from an atmosphere, and the off-center attraction of an oblate or otherwise misshapen body. == Introduction == The study of perturbations began with the first attempts to predict planetary motions in the sky. Physics World, June 2002, p. 41\\. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is contained in the Local Group of more than 54 galaxies. Isaac Newton, at the time he formulated his laws of motion and of gravitation, applied them to the first analysis of perturbations, recognizing the complex difficulties of their calculation.Newton in 1684 wrote: \"By reason of the deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity, the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. The signals are subtracted to reveal a signal between the two galaxies. (Observed via Oxygen-VI absorption lines) * A hot state with temperatures of 105.7–106.3 K. (Observed via Oxygen-VII in soft x-rays) * A very hot state with temperatures of 106.3–107 K. Very few hydrogen or hydrogen like metals, mostly present near the outskirts of galaxy clusters. File:NGC4676.jpg|The Mice Galaxies. The warm phase of the WHIM was detected by soft X-ray absorption in 2012 to establish 15% of total baryon content. The Lyman-alpha forest contains around 28% of the baryons. Clusters are then formed relatively recently between 10 billion years ago and now. * Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect: The hot electrons in the intracluster medium scatter radiation from the cosmic microwave background through inverse Compton scattering. General perturbations is applicable only if the perturbing forces are about one order of magnitude smaller, or less, than the gravitational force of the primary body. This ejection continues until most of the stars near the center of the galaxy have been removed. It has been suggested that galactic cannibalism is currently occurring between the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. A source, such as a quasar, ionizes hydrogen in the cosmic filament leaving detectable dips in the absorption lines. Forces from all perturbing bodies (black and gray) are summed to form the total force on body i (red), and this is numerically integrated starting from the initial position (the epoch of osculation). The ICM is low density with around 10−3 particles per cm3. Encke's method was more widely used before the advent of modern computers, when much orbit computation was performed on mechanical calculating machines. == Periodic nature == In the Solar System, many of the disturbances of one planet by another are periodic, consisting of small impulses each time a planet passes another in its orbit. The y-parameter signal from a galaxy pair is overlaid on a model for galaxy halos. Historically, general perturbations were investigated first. Once applied only to comets and minor planets, special perturbation methods are now the basis of the most accurate machine-generated planetary ephemerides of the great astronomical almanacs.See, for instance, Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris. General perturbations takes advantage of the fact that in many problems of celestial mechanics, the two-body orbit changes rather slowly due to the perturbations; the two-body orbit is a good first approximation. X-ray studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of intergalactic gas known as the intracluster medium. In a system of n mutually interacting bodies, this method mathematically solves for the Newtonian forces on body i by summing the individual interactions from the other j bodies: :\\mathbf{\\ddot{r}}_i = \\sum_{\\underset{j e i}{j=1}}^n {Gm_j (\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i) \\over r_{ij}^3} where \\mathbf{\\ddot{r}}_i is the acceleration vector of body i, G is the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of body j, \\mathbf{r}_i and \\mathbf{r}_j are the position vectors of objects i and j respectively, and r_{ij} is the distance from object i to object j, all vectors being referred to the barycenter of the system. The density of the strands comes up to about 30% of the baryonic density, which the groups said was the exact amount needed to solve the problem. File:NGC 1510 and NGC 1512 in UV Light.jpg|Barred spiral galaxy NGC 1512 in the process of a lengthy merger with dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 1510. Greatly exaggerated here, the small difference δr (blue) between the osculating, unperturbed orbit (black) and the perturbed orbit (red), is numerically integrated starting from the initial position (the epoch of osculation). File:NGC 4298 and NGC 4302 - Heic1709a.jpg|Interacting galaxies NGC 4302 and NGC 4298 both located 55 million light-years away. Infrared searches are more useful for finding more distant (higher redshift) clusters. It has been shown that long-term periodic disturbances within the Solar System can become chaotic over very long time scales; under some circumstances one or more planets can cross the orbit of another, leading to collisions.see references at Stability of the Solar System The orbits of many of the minor bodies of the Solar System, such as comets, are often heavily perturbed, particularly by the gravitational fields of the gas giants. But to consider simultaneously all these causes of motion and to define these motions by exact laws admitting of easy calculation exceeds, if I am not mistaken, the force of any human mind.\" It is believed that cores are produced by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The result is a low-density core. If a planet or other dark object moves between the observer and a faraway source, the image of the source is distorted. A disadvantage is that when perturbations become large in magnitude (as when an object makes a close approach to another) the errors of the method also become large. , chapter 11. *Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect. File:Whirlpool (M51).jpg|The Whirlpool Galaxy with its satellite NGC 5195. A satellite's gravity could attract one of the primary's spiral arms. The hypothetical motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is a conic section, and can be described in geometrical terms. (quoted by Prof G E Smith (Tufts University), in \"Three Lectures on the Role of Theory in Science\" 1. Alternatively, the secondary satellite can dive into the primary galaxy, as in the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy diving into the Milky Way. To ensure the signal is not coming from any other source, astronomers generate a control simulation which they use to compare and are able to determine that source must be from the WHIM. Letting \\boldsymbol{\\rho} be the radius vector of the osculating orbit, \\mathbf{r} the radius vector of the perturbed orbit, and \\delta \\mathbf{r} the variation from the osculating orbit, = \\mathbf{\\ddot{r}} - \\boldsymbol{\\ddot{\\rho}}.|}} \\mathbf{\\ddot{r}} and \\boldsymbol{\\ddot{\\rho}} are just the equations of motion of \\mathbf{r} and \\boldsymbol{\\rho}, = \\mathbf{a}_{\\text{per}} - {\\mu \\over r^3} \\mathbf{r} for the perturbed orbit and |}} = - {\\mu \\over \\rho^3} \\boldsymbol{\\rho} for the unperturbed orbit,|}} where \\mu = G(M+m) is the gravitational parameter with M and m the masses of the central body and the perturbed body, \\mathbf{a}_{\\text{per}} is the perturbing acceleration, and r and \\rho are the magnitudes of \\mathbf{r} and \\boldsymbol{\\rho}. Another disadvantage is that in systems with a dominant central body, such as the Sun, it is necessary to carry many significant digits in the arithmetic because of the large difference in the forces of the central body and the perturbing bodies, although with modern computers this is not nearly the limitation it once was. , p. 91 ff. ==== Encke's method ==== thumb|Encke's method. The density, temperature, and substructure of the intracluster X-Ray gas therefore represents the entire thermal history of cluster formation. Special perturbations are also used for modeling an orbit with computers. ==== Cowell's formulation ==== thumb|Cowell's method. The patches are too dim to see directly, but when overlaid with the visible galaxy distribution, become detectable. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. File:Galactic soup.jpg|Galaxy pair Zw I 136. Encke's method begins with the osculating orbit as a reference and integrates numerically to solve for the variation from the reference as a function of time. Cowell's formulation (so named for Philip H. Cowell, who, with A.C.D. Cromellin, used a similar method to predict the return of Halley's comet) is perhaps the simplest of the special perturbation methods. File:Antennae-RGB-2048-RECOMBINE.jpg | Antennae Galaxies NGC 4038 & NGC 4039 are a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Corvus. ==Galactic cannibalism== thumb|2MASX J16270254+4328340 galaxy has merged with another galaxy leaving a fine mist, made of millions of stars, spewing from it in long trails. In practice, the core-Sersic model can be used to help quantify the deficits. This produces a \"shadow\" in the observed cosmic microwave background at some radio frequencies. The cluster gas can be studied using both X-ray imaging and X-ray spectroscopy. File:NGC 6052.jpg|Galaxy NGC 6052 merging into a single structure. The observed state of gas within a cluster is determined by a combination of shock heating during accretion, radiative cooling, and thermal feedback triggered by that cooling. In effect, the positions and velocities are perturbed directly, and no attempt is made to calculate the curves of the orbits or the orbital elements.Moulton (1914): ch. IX Special perturbations can be applied to any problem in celestial mechanics, as it is not limited to cases where the perturbing forces are small. On-going mutual perturbations of the planets cause long-term quasi-periodic variations in their orbital elements, most apparent when two planets' orbital periods are nearly in sync. At high redshift imaging around individual radio sources (in this case AGN) has been used to detect proto- clusters (clusters in the process of forming). Nonetheless it can still be done, using a range of techniques: * Making use of the Lyman-alpha forest; clouds of diffuse, baryonic gas or dust are sometimes visible when backlit by stars. If there is only one other significant body then the perturbed motion is a three-body problem; if there are multiple other bodies it is an n-body problem. In ancient times the causes were unknown. Since the osculating orbit is easily calculated by two-body methods, \\boldsymbol{\\rho} and \\delta \\mathbf{r} are accounted for and \\mathbf{r} can be solved. This periodic nature led to the discovery of Neptune in 1846 as a result of its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus. These show up as very dim patches in the CMB. In practice, the quantity in the brackets, {\\boldsymbol{\\rho} \\over \\rho^3} - {\\mathbf{r} \\over r^3} , is the difference of two nearly equal vectors, and further manipulation is necessary to avoid the need for extra significant digits. In 25,000 years' time, Earth will have a more circular (less eccentric) orbit than Venus. This is not necessarily so for special perturbations; the motions would be predicted with similar accuracy, but no information on the configurations of the perturbing bodies (for instance, an orbital resonance) which caused them would be available. === Special perturbations === In methods of special perturbations, numerical datasets, representing values for the positions, velocities and accelerative forces on the bodies of interest, are made the basis of numerical integration of the differential equations of motion.Bate, Mueller, White (1971), pp. 387–409. This causes the bodies to follow motions that are periodic or quasi-periodic - such as the Moon in its strongly perturbed orbit, which is the subject of lunar theory. For instance, five orbits of Jupiter (59.31 years) is nearly equal to two of Saturn (58.91 years). The interaction between CMB photons and free electrons leaves an imprint in the CMB. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect occurs when photons from the CMB inverse Compton Scatter off ionized gas. This causes large perturbations of both, with a period of 918 years, the time required for the small difference in their positions at conjunction to make one complete circle, first discovered by Laplace. The WHIM is mostly composed of ionized hydrogen. * Radio: A number of diffuse structures emitting at radio frequencies have been found in clusters. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than ), never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium. This is called a two-body problem, or an unperturbed Keplerian orbit. RAMBOs were proposed by Moore and Silk in 1995. If all perturbations were to cease at any particular instant, the body would continue in this (now unchanging) conic section indefinitely; this conic is known as the osculating orbit and its orbital elements at any particular time are what are sought by the methods of general perturbations. A general analytical solution (a mathematical expression to predict the positions and motions at any future time) exists for the two-body problem; when more than two bodies are considered analytic solutions exist only for special cases. Many of the great mathematicians since then have given attention to the various problems involved; throughout the 18th and 19th centuries there was demand for accurate tables of the position of the Moon and planets for marine navigation. Its advantages are that perturbations are generally small in magnitude, so the integration can proceed in larger steps (with resulting lesser errors), and the method is much less affected by extreme perturbations. Where k_b is Boltzmann's constant, \\sigma_T is the Thompson cross-section, n_e is electron number density, m_ec^2 is the electron rest mass energy, and T_e is the temperature. Lyman-Alpha emission The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission lines are detected from ionized hydrogen in cosmic filament. Its disadvantage is complexity; it cannot be used indefinitely without occasionally updating the osculating orbit and continuing from there, a process known as rectification. Groups of radio sources (that may include diffuse structures or AGN) have been used as tracers of cluster location. Battin (1999), sec. 10.2. Venus currently has the orbit with the least eccentricity, i.e. it is the closest to circular, of all the planetary orbits. A scientist or organization that did solve it to the satisfaction of others would surely earn many prestigious prizes. Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as in the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends on the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention the action of all these on each other. This equation is resolved into components in x, y, and z and these are integrated numerically to form the new velocity and position vectors. While many of these perturbations are periodic, others are not, and these in particular may represent aspects of chaotic motion. Encke's method is similar to the general perturbation method of variation of the elements, except the rectification is performed at discrete intervals rather than continuously. The column density of these lines F(N_O) can be derived: \\Omega_{O}=\\frac{H_0m_O}{c\\rho_c}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}F(N_O)N_OdN_O. The WHIM is composed of three states: * A warm state with temperatures 105–105.7 K. Neutral hydrogen is present in this state. The classical methods are known as variation of the elements, variation of parameters or variation of the constants of integration. Even the two-body problem becomes insoluble if one of the bodies is irregular in shape.Roy (1988): ch. 6, 7. Bate, Mueller, White (1971), sec. 9.3. Methods used have included soft X-ray, OVI, OVII, and OVIII absorption. * X-ray: The hot plasma emits X-rays that can be detected by X-ray telescopes. Substituting from equations () and () into equation (), = \\mathbf{a}_{\\text{per}} + \\mu \\left( {\\boldsymbol{\\rho} \\over \\rho^3} - {\\mathbf{r} \\over r^3} \\right), |}} which, in theory, could be integrated twice to find \\delta \\mathbf{r}. This gas is very hot, between 107K and 108K, and hence emits X-rays in the form of bremsstrahlung and atomic line emission. In these methods, it is considered that the body is always moving in a conic section, however the conic section is constantly changing due to the perturbations. Metal absorption lines Highly ionized oxygen like O+6, O+7, and O+8 absorption lines in the soft X-rays at energies of 0.6 - 0.8 keV. Roy (1988), sec. 7.4. File:Close encounter IRAS 06076-2139.jpg|Close encounter at IRAS 06076-2139. The y-parameter quantifies the strength of the tSZ effect and is defined as: y=\\int \\frac{k_BT_e}{m_ec^2}n_e\\sigma_Td\\ell. The result is usually expressed in terms of algebraic and trigonometric functions of the orbital elements of the body in question and the perturbing bodies. The advantage of Cowell's method is ease of application and programming. This process is repeated as many times as necessary. Since the strands are diffuse and they are not hot enough to emit x-rays, they are difficult to detect. This resulting signal is the filament. Tidal stripping may also have been part of the problem of detecting dwarf galaxies in the first place: Finding dwarf galaxies is an extremely difficult task, since they tend to have low surface
